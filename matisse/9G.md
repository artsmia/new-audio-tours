## Jay Fisher

This is a wonderful sculpture, which the viewer really needs to move around to see it, and Matisse liked to photograph it from straight on and from one side or the other or from the back.  A wonderful indication of how again he saw our ability to view a figure as evolving and changing, as you walk around it.  It takes routes that you never would've expected as the sculpture almost unfolds for you walking around it, it's not predictable.
