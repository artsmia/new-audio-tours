## Henri Matisse

The entire arrangement of my pictures is expressive.  The place occupied by the figures, the empty spaces around them, the proportion, all of that has its share.  In a picture, every part will be visible and will play it appointed role.  Everything that is not useful in a picture is harmful.  A work of art must be harmonious in its entirety.  Any superfluous detail would replace some other essential detail in the mind of the spectator.
