## Henri Matisse

To one's work, one must bring knowledge, much contemplation of the model or other subject and the imagination to enrich what one sees.  Close your eyes and hold the vision and then do the work with your own sensibility.  If it be a model, assume the pose of the model yourself, where the strain comes, it's the key of the movement.
