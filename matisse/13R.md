## Henri Matisse

You understand now why I am never bored.  For over fifty years, I have not stopped working for an instant.  From nine o'clock to noon, first sitting, then I have a little nap and take up my brushes again at two in the afternoon until the evening.  You won't believe me, on Sundays, I have to tell all sorts of tales to the models.  I promised them that it's the last time I will ever beg them to come and pose on that day.  Naturally, I pay them double.  Finally, when I sense that they are not convinced, I promise them a day off during the week.  Mr. Matisse one of them answered me, this has been going on for months and I never had one afternoon off.  Poor things, they don't understand.  Nevertheless, I can't sacrifice my Sundays for them merely because they have boyfriends.
