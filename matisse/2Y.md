## Henri Matisse

I am still on my portraits from photographs of my two Baltimore ladies, which you perhaps don't remember.  I'm finishing them, a somewhat arduous work, what work isn't, particularly so because imagination, memory and the precision of the photograph must join forces to produce the truth.  But all the same, very interesting it's based on two opposing characters from the same family, since they are sisters.  One of them beautiful like great beauty, noble and glorious, lovely hair with ample waves in the old style, satisfied and dominating.  And the other was the Majesty of a Queen of Israel, but with lovely lines that fall, however like those in her face, but with a depth of expression which is touching, always submissive to her glorious sister, but attentive to everything.
