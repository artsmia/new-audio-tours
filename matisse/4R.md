## Erika Holmquist-Wall

Lithography is actually a printing process that's based on the idea that oil and water do not mix.  You use a very large heavy stone or a metal plate and the image is drawn on it, there's acid that's also used to etch portions of the drawing into the stone.  And then, when the stone is moistened, the etched areas retained water. And then an oil ink could be applied over that and it would be repelled by the water, which then sticks to the piece of paper.
