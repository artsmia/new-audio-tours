## Kaywin Feldman

More Matisse please, you will find our third floor brimming with four additional exhibitions of outstanding works from our own collection, all of them created or inspired by Matisse, and on view together for a limited time.  Thanks to the generosity of donors like Ruth and Bruce Dayton, the MIA has a significant collection of Matisse's work in all media.  We were thrilled therefore to join this exhibition tour organized and circulated by the Baltimore Museum of Art.  We are grateful for the generous support for the Minneapolis Presentation of Matisse: Masterworks from the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Our lead sponsor is The Crosby Family Fund for Exhibitions.  Major sponsors are Delta Airlines and Thomson Reuters and additional generous support provided by Christie's Dorsey & Whitney LLP.  The role of Matisse was played by Dominique Serrand, the voice of Etta Cone was Beth Gilliland.  This audio guide was produced and directed by Barbara Weiner, with sound design by Jason Almendinger.
