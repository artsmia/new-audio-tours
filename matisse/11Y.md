## Henri Matisse

In my Nice studio before my departure for Tahiti, I had worked several months on the yellow dress without finishing it.  And during my trip, even while strongly impressed by what I was seeing everyday I often thought of the work I had left unfinished. Might I even say that I thought of it constantly.  Returning to Nice for a month this summer, I went back to the painting and worked on it every day.  Then I left again for America and during the crossing, I realized what I had to do, there is a weakness in the construction of my painting and its possible resolution.
