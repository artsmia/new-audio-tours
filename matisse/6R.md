## Erika Holmquist-Wall

The quality of the light in Southern France is so specific and so distinct, it's subtle, but it's also endlessly varied.  You see outside, you the sea, you see the palm trees, the white washed buildings on the street below.  You have a sense of the shimmering brilliant light outside, but the light also fills the entire room.  There are no shadows, the entire picture plane is flooded.

## Henri Matisse

The richness and the silver clarity of the light of Nice, especially during the beautiful month of January seem to me unique and indispensable to the mind of the artist, especially if he is a painter.
