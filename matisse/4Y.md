## Henri Matisse

Now, I usually do the drawings in the evening, when it's too dark to paint.  When I am mastering them, you see effect of light and shadow, deliberately leaving colors aside.  And then when I go back to my real work the next day, I have subconsciously gained new ways of looking at things, which will benefit the painting, even if it's indirectly.
