## Kaywin Feldman

Eugène Delacroix was an engine of revolution.  He used color and emotion to transform French painting in the 19th century and he helped to define modern art.

Delacroix was extremely influential to the artists of his time and those that came after, especially the Impressionists.  This exhibition presents unique opportunity to see artwork by Delacroix with paintings and drawings by the artists he inspired including Cézanne, Monet and Van Gogh.  Their art creates a visual conversation of color, style, content and form.

On this tour, you will hear insights from curators, conservators and contemporary artists as you get to know Delacroix as an artist and a person.

I am Kaywin Feldman, Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Director  & President, of Minneapolis Institute of Art.  I am pleased to welcome you to Mia on our 100th year.  Please enjoy your visit to _Delacroix's Influence: The Rise of Modern Art, from Cézanne to Van Gogh_.
