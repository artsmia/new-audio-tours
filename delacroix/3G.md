## Patrick Noon

You see in the sketch how he composes, it's like almost instantaneous, it's like one go.  Everything gets painted quickly, everything is in balance but everything is put down really fast, there's no hesitation, there's no finishing parts, there's no doing this here in this corner, now I will go to this corner, it's all done in one fast put down of the composition which he's already thought out in his head.  And once he gets that down he can then move on and produce a larger picture, not as fast and he always writes about the fact that it's a shame that in finishing a picture you start to lose some of the energy you have in your preparatory work and the key is to try not to lose too much.
