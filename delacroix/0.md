## Eric Bruce

Welcome to Delacroix's Influence on The Rise of Modern Art, CÃ©zanne to Van Gogh, I am Eric Bruce, Head of Visitor Experience here at MIA.  I will be your guide.

This audio tour will take you through the galleries and provide insight into 24 remarkable paintings chosen specifically for you by the exhibition curators.  There is so much interesting information for these amazing paintings that we've offered additional stop layers providing you the choice to learn more.  Listen to as many or as few as you like.  I will let you know the focus of each additional stop as we go along and you can make your choice using the colored buttons.

We will begin our tour with an introduction from Kaywin Feldman the Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Director & President, Minneapolis Institute of Art.  Start by pressing the Green button.
