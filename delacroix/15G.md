## Lamar Peterson

These reds are so vivid and deep. The blood as well as the hunter's cloaks are very intense and bright.  Also the use of light as well and modeling on the lioness' fur as well as the fabric of the hunters is very dramatic and intense.  I think, he had an eye for the drama of an image bringing in the viewer with something that might be shocking, holding their view and engaging them, allowing the viewer to walk away and have so many different directions that they could take what they have just viewed.

It's obvious that he was making work for himself.  He was making work that excited him and it's definitely something that I think about in my own work. How can I make work for myself and second guess it and let it speak for itself when it's out in the world?
