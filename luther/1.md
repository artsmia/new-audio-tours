## Kaywin Feldman

Hello. I'm Kaywin Feldman, the Duncan and Nivin MacMillan, Director and President of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. And I'm pleased to welcome you to Martin Luther: Art and the Reformation, presented by Thrivent Financial.

This unprecedented exhibition marks the 500th anniversary of the presentation of the 95 Theses, an event that shook Europe to its core and changed history forever.

As you tour the exhibition, you will learn about this momentous event and its aftermath through archaeological finds from Luther's homes, his personal effects, letters and studies from his own hand, and books that he published. You will also see the glorious art of the world into which he was born, as well as the works of art that he and his supporters used to give shape to their views on faith. You will also see the often incendiary artwork that allowed his supporters and detractors to publicly argue their opposing positions.

Thank you for visiting Mia and Martin Luther: Art and the Reformation.
