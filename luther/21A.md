## Rabbi Norman M. Cohen

People regard the Reformation as a significant turning point in the history of religion. This exhibition intentionally includes some problematic materials. Luther wrote about non-Christian religions, in particular, my religion Judaism. These specific writings caused tremendous damage and pain which now, over the last few decades, is being addressed. The fact that these materials are included in this exhibit is remarkable.

Luther's first significant piece on the Jews written in 1523 was seemingly positive. It was called “That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew.” However, upon closer critical scholarship it appears to have been motivated by Luther's desire to proselytize and convert the Jews to Christianity, teaching Jews the error of their ways.

Oh, this is known in religious dialogue as Triumphalism, Supersessionism, and also Replacement Theology. And that's the claim that Christianity triumphed over, superseded, and replaced Judaism as the only heir to the Biblical Covenant. And that's anathema to contemporary interfaith dialogue and mutual respect.

In the context of the Middle Ages this approach may be understandable, and it's certainly not exceptional. However, Luther's realization that such efforts to save Jewish souls were not only failing, but also working in reverse, witnessing the conversion of some Christians to Judaism, and this prompted a different approach.

He changed his tone in a book written twenty years later in 1543 called, "On the Jews and Their Lies.” In it he reiterated many themes found in classical anti-Semitic literature, including the demonization of the Jews, declaring their rejection by God and also perpetuating the blood libel that Jews kill Christians. For Luther, the good old-fashioned theological anti-Semitism was not enough.

In this treatise, Luther also suggested specific actions against the Jews of his day, some of which were in his own words:

“Set fire to their synagogues or schools and bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn. Their houses should also be broken down and destroyed. They should be deprived of their prayer books and Talmuds. Their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach anymore. The Jews’ safe conduct on the highway should be abolished completely. All-cash and treasure of silver and gold should be taken from them and put aside for safe keeping. One should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of their pants, eject them forever from our country.” 

And he told the readers, “Whenever you see a genuine Jew you may with good conscience cross yourself and say, there goes the devil incarnate.”

One biographer of Luther expressed the regret, one could only wish that Luther had died before ever this tract was written. While it would be inaccurate to accuse the Lutheran Church of causing the Holocaust, it's difficult not to see Luther's words a foreshadowing of some of what the Nazis directed against the Jews 400 years later.

In fact the Nazis republished and distributed "On the Jews and Their Lies.” At the Nuremberg trials, Nazi propagandist, Julius Streicher stated and I'm going to quote, "Dr. Martin Luther would very probably sit in my place in the defendant's dock today if this book had been taken into consideration by the prosecution."

While the German Lutheran church founded by Martin Luther was not directly responsible for the Holocaust which was based on racial not theological definition of Jews, there is this undeniable link. The church's response to the rise of Hitler and the unfolding of the Shoah, the Hebrew word for Holocaust, was compromised by the centuries of the pernicious influence of Luther and his well-developed hatred of the Jews as a religion and as a people. This is part of the toxin from which the Holocaust arose.

Now we're grateful today, Jews and Christians alike, that a beginning of some redemption can be found in frank and open dialogue. The church continues to acknowledge and disavow those hateful writings of their founder, Martin Luther. Healthy, respectful dialogue, whose purpose is to learn and understand not to proselytize, not to slander, has been evident in many interfaith programs in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> Centuries.

In addition, exhibitions such as the one you are experiencing right here at the Minneapolis Institute of Art are including these documents and opportunities for thoughtful discussion which can lead to positive change in our community. This exhibition is a welcome part of our community's activities.
