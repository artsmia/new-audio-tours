## Johan Van Parys

In terms of the Catholic Church we have Seven Sacraments, one of which is the Sacrament of Reconciliation formerly known as Penance, and during Sacrament of Reconciliation, we confess our sins, and our sins are forgiven. But we are given a penance to make amends. And this penance is sort of symbolic; it's for what the real penance might be. An indulgence says that your penance has been forgiven. And so, affirming God's mercy, where we get in trouble is where these indulgences could be bought. That's the opposite of saying that indulgences affirm God's mercy. It says, "You have to buy them," that's where we went wrong in terms of the indulgences, but in essence, they are affirmation of God's incredible mercy.
