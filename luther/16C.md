## Joanna Lindell

The Reformation was really challenging and difficult and destructive for many aspects of artistic society and individual artists. Many artists in Germany moved and went to different cities to continue to create art because a lot of the reformers had concerns over art in general. They worried about that notion of worship of images.

To the Catholic Church the idea would be that the image could help inspire devotion and remind and so a person's prayer might go through the image up to God. And Luther ultimately embraced, acknowledged and accepted and loved the arts, in particular music, but also the visual arts. And he and Lutherans really felt again that that image was something that could really be instrumental and inspirational for educational purposes.

This was extraordinarily important to Lutherans and to many reformers, but that devotional piece is, well this object is very important educationally, but our prayers go directly to God. And then the radical reformers really said, no absolutely no images and the prayer has to go direct to God. And so this is why some of the radical reformers of course participated in the very violent and destructive act of iconoclasm which Luther did not condone.
