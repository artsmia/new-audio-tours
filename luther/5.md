We have a very rare object in this gallery, the robe of Emperor Maximilian. Louis Nebelsick is going to tell you all about it.

## Louis Nebelsick

Well, Emperor Maximilian, he was one of those great leaders of Central Europe, who was able to pull things together to defend Europe. He was also a believer, and he would go on pilgrimages and if you went on pilgrimage, you didn't go in your jewels and you didn't go in yourâ€¦you went in a simple smock. And so he wears a simple smock, but he's the emperor. So what is the simple smock made of, the finest silk that there was at the time with this amazing embroideries that were done on it, yes. So on the one hand, symbolically, he is going as a simple pilgrim and people would look at that and say, yes, he's a good man, he is a holy man, but he's the emperor. So I mean, he is not going to go in rags, is he? So he is sort of, he is showing both, he is still showing that he's the emperor, but he is showing his piety and that he has stripped his, almost as if he were naked. He's sort of going in, it would be like seeing your president in his undershirt and his underpants walking down the street to church. Your president says, I am just a sinner like you. Yes. And so that's what he is doing when he is wearing this smock.
