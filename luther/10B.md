## Mary Jane Haemig

Indulgences conveyed the idea that God's mercy could be bought and sold. That the absolution that the priest pronounced forgiving sins was not in fact enough, rather that absolution the Medieval Church taught applied only to the guilt of sin. The punishment for sin was something different, and the punishment remained. And if you didn't want to spend some time in purgatory after death, you had to be concerned with getting rid of that punishment now. And that's what an indulgence was designed to do.

Luther thought that this was nonsense. God's mercy was not for sale. God's mercy was free. The church was misleading people by making them think that they could, by some act of their own - by buying an indulgence - could satisfy God's anger and get rid of God's judgment. Rather God's mercy, according to Luther, takes care of God's judgment.
