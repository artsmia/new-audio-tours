Dr. Tomoko Emmerling recounts the stories of this remarkable pulpit never before seen in a public space.

## Dr. Tomoko Emmerling

Eisleben is the city where Martin Luther was born, in 1483; one year before his parents moved to Mansfeld, where his childhood home is. And Martin Luther during his life came to Mansfeld several times, and he went there to mediate in a conflict between the Counts of Mansfeld. On his way there, he had a heart attack, and he was an ill man; elderly and had different illnesses. But he nevertheless took part in the meetings and in the negotiations. And he preached from the pulpit in St. Andrews Church.

So, this pulpit is the pulpit of the Church where Luther preached two days before he died; the last sermon of his life. This was on February 15, 1546. He had another heart attack, and he died on February 17.

This is really extraordinary for an exhibition, because this has been preserved in the church. It was always used by the church by the congregation and by the pastors, and people were always aware of it as the place of Luther's last sermons.

The reason why we are able to exhibit this piece in Minneapolis is that Minneapolis Institute of Art generously sponsors restoration of the pulpit - one of the highlights of the exhibition. This is really unusual, because normally the pulpit is in the church and stays in the church is being used in the church, so this is a unique opportunity. I think it is the only exhibition ever where one can see this pulpit, because of course after the exhibition, they go back to the church, it will be reassembled in the church, so that it can be used again as a pulpit for the sermons, for the services.
