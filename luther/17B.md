## Armin Kuntz

The image of Katharina von Bora and Luther as a couple, what is Cranach doing here? Cranach shows this rebellious monk who on top of everything else, you know being a monk, said, "Well, I'm just like this whole celibate thing, this doesn't work for me. So I'm actually going to marry that nun." And Cranach, what he is depicting here is not a noble man, he is not depicting a ruler, a prince, a lord or anything like that, but he is depicting a monk. So, he basically ennobled Luther, his wife Katharina von Bora to prevent them in the same way as usually only noble people are represented.

And I think that's a very important point to make because we forget about it. We're so familiar with those images. This is not just, "Oh well, another pair from the workshop," because he probably did many of them, we get all tired of them. We see them all over the place, and every kind of historical survey, but to actually realize what has actually happened here that basically all those representational means that were developed in the courtly context are now transferred to an intellectual religious movement which is the Reformation. So I think we have to remember how daring and actually revolutionary it is.
