## Mary Jane Haemig

Why the 95 Theses are crucial to the Reformation? I’m not sure they are crucial, but they got a reforming process going, and they were the first thing that was really public, and that put Luther out into the public in the role of questioning what the Church said.

In the 95 Theses, Luther addresses the limits of papal authority and Church authority over the penalty on a persons' sin. He attacks the claims of indulgence preachers. He talks about what true preaching is, and what the true treasury of the Church is. For Luther, the true treasury of the Church was the Gospel, the good news of God's mercy and Jesus Christ.

Luther's 95 Theses also includes a plea to bishops to rein in the indulgence preachers. Again, he is being a good respectful monk. He has seen some poor practices in the Church, some poor theology, "Oh, bishops don't you want to correct this?" Maybe he was naïve at that point.
