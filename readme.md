# Audio tours from Mia.

Markdown format inspired by [ACMI's static audio guide](https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide).

Slight modifications made to allow for multiple audio tours to be built
using the same [jekyll machinery](https://github.com/artsmia/static-museum-audio-guide).

[Replaces an older jekyll-powered audio guide](https://github.com/artsmia/turnip).

TODO

- [ ] indexes: show <tour>/index.md at /<tour> and link all tours from _site/index.html
