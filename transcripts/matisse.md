**Narrator's Introduction and Welcome**

Male Speaker 1:  Welcome to the exhibition Matisse: Masterworks from the Baltimore Museum of Art.  The tour stops are numbered from 1 to 15.  You can, however, listen to them in any order.  You can move back and forth through the gallery as you like.  Most of the art works featured on this guide have more than one audio stop to offer additional layers of information.  My name is Eric Bruce. I am Head of Visitor Experience at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  I will guide you to each of these stops.  The expert voices you will hear on this audio guide are scholars of modern art with unique insights into the artist, Henri Matisse.  We begin our tour with an introduction from Kaywin Feldman, Director and President of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Kaywin Feldman:  Every generation has its innovators, its Leonardo da Vincis, Albert Einsteins, Marie Curies, Rosa Parks, Steve Jobs, people full of creativity, grit and ingenuity who push through barriers, create new things and ideas and expand our understanding of humanity's great potential.  French artist Henri Matisse is one of those groundbreaking individuals in the world of modern art.  Hello, I am Kaywin Feldman, Director and President at the Minneapolis Institute of arts and I am pleased to welcome you to Matisse: Masterworks from the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Matisse spent more than 50 years pushing himself to explore the expressive possibilities of color, line, shape and pattern.  You will find the exhibition organized chronologically to illustrate Matisse's development as an artist.  Before leaving this room, take a moment to get acquainted with Henri Matisse and two of his biggest supporters, legendary collectors Dr. Claribel Cone and Ms. Etta Cone.  You will see their photographs on the wall nearby.  You will also hear from Etta Cone and Matisse throughout the tour.

**Matisse and the Cone Sisters of Baltimore**

Male Speaker:  Erika Holmquist-Wall is Assistant Curator and Provenance Specialist in the department of paintings at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.  She is also Exhibition Curator for this venue on the National Tour of Matisse: Masterworks from the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Henri Matisse was definitely one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century.  And when you see pictures of Matisse, he's kind of like this kindly gent, he is kind of like your grandfather with his little suit and his glasses and his little white beard.  He comes across as kindly even though he has this incredibly intense side to him.  He is completely involved in what he's doing.  He gives himself entirely to it, he can't tear himself away from it.  Although he was trained as a lawyer and started working in a law firm, he never really fit into being a lawyer.  He actually said "I just got really tired of listening to other people's quarrels."  And in his early 20s he had a bout of appendicitis which confined him to his bed.  His mother actually purchased him a box of paints, and that was it for him, it changed everything.

Henri Matisse:  The moment I had this box of colors in my hand, I had the feeling that my life was there.  It was a great allurement, a kind of paradise in which I was completely free, alone, tranquil.  Before, nothing interested me.  After that I had nothing on my mind, but painting.

Male Speaker 1:  Press the green button to learn how Henri Matisse was a radical innovator in modern art.  Katherine Rothkopf is Curator of European Painting and Sculpture at the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Select the red button and she'll introduce you to Sisters Etta and Claribel Cone.  To hear from Matisse in his own words, choose the yellow button.

**Henri Matisse, modern art innovator**

Katherine Rothkopf:  Matisse, he is a very easy entry point into understanding modern art and what made it so radical.  Everything we kind of study in art 101, color, line, pattern, shape, form, he is mastering it, he is working through the basic elements and fundamentals of what we see and how we see it and he is pushing himself and he is pushing the boundaries.  He is trying out these radical new innovations with color, with light.  You know once he masters something, he kind of moves on to the next thing, but he always circles back.  He works at the same motifs and the same issues over and over again, throughout his career.  If you really look at his work, there is an underlying current of consistency, the human figure is generally his subject.  And so it's through these, by sticking to these same motifs over and over, he is able to push and revisit and go back and experiment with color and line and plains and composition and lights and he made everything look so easy.  But really, he really worked.  He worked very hard to make things look easy.  I mean, that was his gift.

**The Cone Sisters of Baltimore**

Katherine Rothkopf:  Claribel and Etta Cone are sisters from Baltimore, really became the greatest collectors of Matisse's work, certainly in a private collection.  Etta Cone, the younger of the two sisters, first met Matisse in 1906.  The previous year she had been introduced to Pablo Picasso by a family friend, Gertrude Stein, who of course went on to be a great writer.  She and her brother Leo Stein had moved to Paris from the United States in the early years of the 20th century.  They become very involved with local art scene, met artists and writers and musicians and their apartment on the Le Flores [Phonetic] [0:00:40] in Paris become a place for great thinkers and creative types to get together on a weekly basis.  When the Cone sisters would go to Paris to visit them, as they did on occasion, they would get to meet some of these people.

Gertrude Stein's sister in law Sarah Stein introduced Etta Cone to Matisse and thus began a many decades-long relationship and friendship that proved to be important to both of them.  Claribel Cone was the elder of the two sisters. She was a medical doctor. She was from the first generation female doctors in the United States, and was able to devote herself to her passion, which turned out to be collecting art.  She loved painting, she loved big sexy, juicy paintings.  The family money came from the textile business, their two oldest brothers Moses and Ceasar Cone provided stipend to both sisters, because they were able to have the funds to be able to travel.  Starting in 1898, Etta Cone purchased her first work for the collection and stopped when she died in 1949.

And, for her, I think, you know, she just really liked Matisse as a person, she loved what he made and she was really so inspired by his creative process.  And so I think for Etta, it ended up becoming how she identified herself later in her life after her sister had died.  She really was very proud of her Matisse collection, proud of the relationship she had with him and with his family.

**Matisse in his own words**

Henri Matisse:  I am still on my portraits from photographs of my two Baltimore ladies, which you perhaps don't remember.  I'm finishing them, a somewhat arduous work, what work isn't, particularly so because imagination, memory and the precision of the photograph must join forces to produce the truth.  But all the same, very interesting it's based on two opposing characters from the same family, since they are sisters.  One of them beautiful like great beauty, noble and glorious, lovely hair with ample waves in the old style, satisfied and dominating.  And the other was the Majesty of a Queen of Israel, but with lovely lines that fall, however like those in her face, but with a depth of expression which is touching, always submissive to her glorious sister, but attentive to everything.

**Jaguar Devouring a Hare**

Male Speaker 1:  Jay Fisher is deputy director for Curatorial Affairs at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Jay Fisher:  This Matisse sculpture called Jaguar Devouring a Hare which was made about 1899, 1901 is a copy of great sculpture we call an Animal Yeh [Phonetic] [0:00:22] a sculptor that specialized in doing sculptures of animal, Antoine-Louis Barye and his Jaguar Devouring a Hare in 1850.  There a number of wonderful drawings that we have that Matisse made of the very sculpture.  Barye was an artist that other artists loved to study and he was kind of an artist's artist.  And there were many major Baryes in the loop.  So artists were fascinated with him because of how he could show some of the same qualities that one describes about Matisse's sculpture: tension, the musculature, the torsion or things that Barye achieved in his reliving [Phonetic] [0:01:10] by going to the Zoo in Paris and sitting there making drawings of animals.

And somehow when he finishes either painting or making sculptures of them, we think that they are out in the deepest Africa, you are actually witnessing these animals in combat.  So it was a kind of realist response for Barye, but what an artist like Matisse saw with his amazing ability to show torsion and musculature.

Male Speaker 1:  To hear how Matisse felt inspiration from Antoine-Louis Barye's earlier Jaguar and Hare sculpture, press the green button.  Select the red button to hear Matisse himself explain the demands of sculpture as an artistic medium.

**Feeling the inspiration of Antione-Louis Bayre**

Jay Fisher:  Yes, it's a Jaguar, but it almost looks just like a muscle, you just feel it contracting and the Jaguar attacks the hare.  So Matisse has a plaster cast of the sculpture, there is a picture of his studio in Paris with a plaster cast of the sculpture sitting on the step.  So it probably was something that he might have purchased for his students to work from or just for himself.  So he chose this sculpture because he saw interesting possibilities that he wanted learn about.  He started working on the sculpture and we understand that he often would work on his copy of the Barye with his eyes closed, because he wanted to feel the linear rhythm as he ran his hand down the back of the model.  And then of his own sculpture, he could feel how that actually was within his hands and how he could model the curving torso of the Jaguar's body, just in his hands.

The idea that he didn't want to be distracted by realism, he didn't want to be distracted with making it look like a Jaguar and making it look exactly like the Barye.  He just wanted to get the essence of that musculature and how there was this curvilinear twist of the Jaguar's body from the head to the tail.  He didn't want to be distracted by realism, he wanted to feel it, as he ran his hands across that modeling the wet clay.

**Matisse on the demands of sculpture**

Henri Matisse:  A sculpture must invite us to handle it as an object and just so the sculptor must feel in making it, the particular demands for volume and mass.  The smaller the bit of sculpture, the more the essentials of form must exist.

**Lithographs of Germaine Raynal**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again is Erika Holmquist-Wall, Assistant Curator and Provenance Specialist in the Department of Paintings at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Matisse had kind of dabbled in printmaking.  He always painted, he always drew but he returned to sculpture and printmaking at different times in his career, when he was stuck with a problem, with line or movement or shape to explore, to get his thoughts out.  And then he would return to painting and drawing.  In 1913, he caused an incredible stir with this set of lithographs.  They were bold, they were shocking.  They have got this amazing power, there was a personality that's conveyed, she's lively, she is full of movement, she is full of vitality.  The prints as simple as they are, they capture her personality and what's really interesting, The thought was, that for decades, nobody knew who the sitter was.  You know, there has been all these studies on Matisse's models, volumes have been written and nobody knew who this sitter was.

And then it was actually revealed that the sitter was Germaine Raynal who was the wife of the very well known art critic at the time, Maurice Raynal.  And the Raynals had fallen on hard times, and Matisse agreed to pay Madame Raynal and he paid her a very generous sum for some modeling sessions.  He did a series of 8 lithographs of Madame Raynal.  When you see the photograph of her, there is no doubt that it's her.  Look at how he captures, how he captures her essence, how he captures her personality.

Male Speaker 1:  Press the green button to hear Erika Holmquist-Wall discuss these lithographs.  What is a lithograph, press the red button for an explanation of this printmaking process.  To hear Matisse explain the value of drawing which is the basis for his lithographs, select the yellow button.

**Nude in a Rocking Chair**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Imagine him working very, very quickly capturing the essence of the model, capturing the shape of her body, the features of her face.  These are simple, clean, pure line drawings.  And in the lithograph where she is leaning forward, the nude [Phonetic] [0:00:22] in the rocking chair, there is all this movement.  She's relaxed, she's smiling and there is something about this seated nude viewed from behind where you see her back and her hair tied up at little buns.  There's something very Japanese about it in the use of the space, the angle that tells of her body.  I think what's really interesting when you're looking at these lithographs is that they are so expressive. They are so powerful. They are so simple.  They are drawn very quickly, there are no revisions.  He doesn't go back in and fuss or tweak, it's instantaneous, it's a snapshot.  In 1913, I mean look how kind of radical these are.

**What is a lithograph**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Lithography is actually a printing process that's based on the idea that oil and water do not mix.  You use a very large heavy stone or a metal plate and the image is drawn on it, there's acid that's also used to etch portions of the drawing into the stone.  And then, when the stone is moistened, the etched areas retained water. And then an oil ink could be applied over that and it would be repelled by the water, which then sticks to the piece of paper.

**Matisse on the importance of drawing to his process**

Henri Matisse:  Now, I usually do the drawings in the evening, when it's too dark to paint.  When I am mastering them, you see effect of light and shadow, deliberately leaving colors aside.  And then when I go back to my real work the next day, I have subconsciously gained new ways of looking at things, which will benefit the painting, even if it's indirectly.

**Sculptures of Aurore, Serpentine and Two Women**

Male Speaker 1:  Again, here is Jay Fisher of the Baltimore Museum of Art with commentary on the three sculptures of women grouped together in this room.

Jay Fisher:  Now why Matisse made sculpture is that it helped him to paint.  The fact that he could make modeling figure tangible, so to literally get his hands around it, it made him understand how to paint a figure in a painting.

Henri Matisse:  I took up sculpture because what interested me in painting was a clarification of my ideas.  I changed my method and worked in clay in order to have a rest from painting, in which I had done absolutely all that I could for the time being.  That is to say that it was done for the purpose of organization, to put order into my feelings to find [Indiscernible] [0:00:52] to suit me.  And when I found it in sculpture, it helped me in my painting.  It was always in view of a complete possession of my mind, a sort of hierarchy of all my sensations, that I kept working in the hope of finding an ultimate conclusion.

Jay Fisher:  Matisse is totally integrated and so in that way, it all works together.  A Matisse moves from one medium to the next to find the best way that he can learn and develop his ideas.  He does different things with drawing too.  If there is a drawing that's linear, he is trying to explore one thing.  If he decides to use charcoal and model it, model volume with in light and dark, [Indiscernible] [0:01:39] then it's about something else.  It's about modeling three-dimensional form, so he can move from looking at a figure as a silhouette to one that's modeled as a volume.  And he knows the best medium to play with, depending on what he's trying to inform his vision.

Male Speaker 1:  Choose the green button to listen to Jay Fisher discuss the sculpture of the standing woman called The Serpentine.  For tips on viewing the Reclining Nude sculpture Of Aurora press the red button.  To learn about the cultural of the Two Standing Women, select the yellow button.

**The Serpentine**

Jay Fisher:  There is an early picture of Matisse actually working on what we know of as The Serpentine sculpture and we know that Matisse based this pose on a photograph that he got from a series of photographs that were probably made for an artist to work from.  And in this case, the photograph that he was looking at just showed a woman posing in a studio leaning on support, but she was definitely a more chunky figure.  The sculpture that we end up with is different, she's become amazingly linear.  It's as if she is changed from sculpture that have modeled volume to one that almost looks like a drawing in space.  Again, that's what fun to participate in as you walk around this sculpture is to begin to see the areas of the sculpture that open up into the space and the areas that are close.  So it's almost like she's kind of – as you are walking around, she's kind of turning with you and you see different areas, like that space between her arms and the body.

You see those as opening up into space or closing off.  The fluidity of this sculpture with those curving lines is really an amazing thing to experience.  I think this is Matisse's most radical sculpture, we realize it's simply a model in the studio and it becomes almost this abstraction of a linear rhythm.

**Reclining Nude I (Aurore)**

Jay Fisher:  I can just feel him with his hands on that sculpture modeling and figuring out how to give that reclining figure such a strong sense of volume and energy and also the way, the way that figure twists in space, tension again is so much an important part of the Matisse's sculpture.  You can wander around and look at it from every different angle.  Matisse once had this photograph so that he was looking down on it and it gives an entirely different impression.  It's amazing about Matisse's sculpture because as you wander around the sculptures, you can't even anticipate what you are going to see.  It's not just symmetric and you think okay, I am going to see the front, then I am going to see the back.  In the case of these sculptures, you get entirely different views, you see things that you never knew were there.  So it definitely involves your involvement, the audience really needs to work at looking at this sculpture by going around it and taking the time to see how it changes.

As you're walking around to the back of the sculpture, it's nice to pause when you're looking at it long way, so you would be looking from the point of view of the feet towards the head.  And there you see, this wonderful curvilinear structure as the feet and the bent knees connect to the thighs and the buttocks and then your eye keeps moving up the sculpture to the torso and to the head and the arm that's extended over the head.  What you most notice as you move around the sculpture is that it becomes more linear as you see its perspective.  Then when you get around to looking at it exactly from this extended back, then you begin to see, especially with the raised arm and the head and how she is kind of lifted herself off the base, then you begin to notice the positives and negatives, the empty areas and the areas that are filled in.  And this is, of course, very similar to another sculpture that's in the show, which is The Serpentine which was only done a year or two later than the reclining nude one.

**Two Women**

Jay Fisher:  The two women is another one, an important work to look at in the same time.  So you know, we are still in the 1907-1908-1909 period.  And Matisse is obviously trying a lot of different things.  One thing that we can see when we look at Matisse's sculpture and his drawings and his prints, is that he liked to work in different mode.  So he did something as distinctive as The Serpentine, but as linear and abstracted as The Serpentine is, The Two Women seems much more chunky and about a solid kind of modeling.  You could see they are by the same artist, no doubt about that, but he doesn't have it all the same objective.  What's interesting with The Two Women is that he is again working from a photograph.  As you look at the photograph of these two women, you can see how Matisse must've loved it, because of the way that there are pose together.

And you can see what the front looks like and the back looks like, but they're also relating to one another, it's an affectionate pose.  It's one where the two are actually looking at each other.  When you look at the sculpture I feel that he's exaggerated the character of the figures, he made them a lot rougher.  I think he's exaggerated the buttocks, exaggerated the torso, you very much see something that's modeled.  And you can again feel Matisse's hand, his fingers and his thumb actually modeling this volume, these two figures.  You feel the musculature sort of moving in and out as you walk around the sculpture.

**The Early Years in Nice**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again is Erika Holmquist-Wall, Associate Curator of Paintings at the MIA and Exhibition Curator.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  In 1917 Matisse was only 50 years old, he had already experienced considerable success, he was very comfortable and well off financially.  He was already being hailed as a modern master.  He was always pushing himself, he had already pushed the boundaries of color and I think he didn't want to feel complacent.  So he leaves everything behind and he rents a hotel room in Nice on the Mediterranean Coast in Southern France, a small hotel room for the winter.  He fell in love and for the rest of his life, he spent part of every year in Nice.  It was the light, it was the color, it was probably the ease of living.  I suppose we would all fall in love with Nice, if we were able to spend our winters there.  All of sudden his art undergoes this incredible shift.  At the same time that he is dialing things back, he is pushing it forward very subtly.

Many Matisse scholars kind of talk about, oh his Nice period as very sort of subdued or conservative become it often just features pretty girls in these interiors.  And there is nothing quite shocking about it, they are very pleasant.  You know, he has mastered color and now he is turning his attention to light.  So a lot of these pictures that we are looking at, they are interiors, but they are also window scenes.  So he is capturing the brilliance of the light outside and he is also working to capture how light diffuses, how light lands on objects, how it enhances.  These paintings, they are still flooded with color, they are very intense.  But now he is really working to play with light and how light plays on color.  The light is both brilliant, it's both filtered, it pervades the entire picture surface.  There are no little dark shadows, there is no dark corners, that's the key to understanding the Nice pictures from the 1920s.

To learn more about the special qualities of natural light in Nice from Erika Holmquist-Wall press the red button.  Choose the yellow button to hear insights on the painting, the music lesson.

**Matisse's introduction to Nice**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  It's interesting, you know. Matisse was born in the northern part of France, very near to the Belgian border.  And his early years have had much more of a northern sensibility, and he painted a lot of dark paintings.  And when he married Amélie, his wife, she was from the more southern part of France and he started going to visit his in-laws.  And really, I think become interested in the difference in light in different parts of the world and different parts even of his own country.  When he got to Nice, I think he really opened up to this new life of beautiful color, beautiful light, beautiful food, beautiful people, it just was a more relaxing and very productive place for him to be.  There was much less stress and I think his years in Paris and his success is about making great pictures.

And I think when you got to Nice, it's sort of like, he took a huge breath and calmed and everything was very, was much easier for him.  And he was able to produce great pictures and have a relaxing and comfortable life there.  And so maybe the early years in Nice I guess, you could think of as being a little bit lighter, a little bit airier, as he is enjoying his new freedom or a new sense of peace.  But I think as the decade goes on, he may be starting to feel like it's time for the next phase.

**The natural light of Nice**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  The quality of the light in Southern France is so specific and so distinct, it's subtle, but it's also endlessly varied.  You see outside, you the sea, you see the palm trees, the white washed buildings on the street below.  You have a sense of the shimmering brilliant light outside, but the light also fills the entire room.  There are no shadows, the entire picture plane is flooded.

Henri Matisse:  The richness and the silver clarity of the light of Nice, especially during the beautiful month of January seem to me unique and indispensable to the mind of the artist, especially if he is a painter.

**The Music Lesson**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  The music lesson is, I think, a really terrific picture that showcases, not only one of Matisse's favorite model of the day, Harriet who we see on the left.  But he also includes his daughter, Marguerite that we see on the right.  Harriet has a violin under her arm and a bow and Marguerite is looking at the music and they look so serious in studying the music in front of them.  Now we know that Matisse was a very enthusiastic violinist, he practiced every day.  Now Marguerite was someone who was of great importance to her father.  And she was sort of the lynchpin of the family who spent so much time with her father, helping him in the studio, helping an adult helping him run the business, you know doing the correspondence for purchases and shipments and organizing the financial side of the business.  But she also was someone that he loved to paint.  Today we have got this great record of this really strong and important force in his life in this lovely [Indiscernible] [0:01:15] it sure is like the music lesson.  It seems that Harriet and Marguerite got along very well and so through the sort of early 20s are quite a few pictures of them together and this is one of my favorites.

**Large Cliff with Fish**

Male Speaker 1:  Katherine Rothkopf is Curator of European Painting and Sculpture at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Katherine Rothkopf [Indiscernible] [0:00:09] with fish is a painting that Matisse made in 1920, when he and the family were in Étretat on the Normandy coast.  And they were there actually because his daughter Marguerite, his eldest daughter, who was a wonderful person and someone he was absolutely devoted to, she had had a long history of ill health.  She had a tracheotomy as a young girl and it never fully resolved itself and so in 1920, she had been ill for a long time and they finally had a very successful surgery.  And so the family went to Étretat to recuperate, to be in the fresh air.  And luckily the surgery was a success and she went on to have a very happy and healthy life after this point.  But Matisse of course needs to still paint, while he was there with the family.  So it's interesting, like it's a big landscape, yet it's a still life all at once, which is an unusual combination.  I mean usually when you have still life in an interior, you have a landscape in figure, but to have this sort of offering of you know the bounty of Étretat is basically what this is.  It's a very odd combination, but so beautifully painted, particularly the beach scene with these lovely colors and then he had a very hard dark, I guess it's the wet beach and with the fish on top.  It is an object's position, but so beautiful and so transient in nature, like all still lives are, it's a little bit of impressionism.  He is looking back to those sort of fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, he has chosen a more gray day, which gives everything a kind of steely feel to it, which I really think is interesting and quite beautiful in its own way.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  To copy objects in a still life is nothing.  One must render the emotion, the awakening.

Male Speaker 1:  Select the green button to learn about Matisse's friendship with French Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir.  Collector Etta Cone was concerned about the fate of the fish in this painting, press the red button to hear more.  To hear from Matisse in his own words about painting landscapes, choose the yellow button.

**Matisse's friendship with Pierre-Auguste Renoir**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  When he went to Nice at the end of 1917 for the first time , one of the first things he did, was to visit Pierre-Auguste Renoir who was living nearby.  The great old master of Impressionism, who was quite elderly but still very much interested in what was going on and was a contemporary artist of the day.  They struck up quite a nice friendship and spent a lot of time together in 1918 and 1919.  And Renoir told Matisse, it was really important for him to look at the landscape to get a break from interiors, to really think about where he was and to really think about exploring the beauties that were available just within easy striking distance.  And so starting just after the conversation, Matisse did a whole group of landscapes.  I mean it's just so funny to think about the relationship between who comes when, Matisse is still alive in the 50s, when Jackson Pollock is painting in New York.  And if you think of them being in such different places, it's sort of the same way with Renoir and Matisse, you think oh that was so long so, but it really wasn't.

**Etta Cone's concern for the fish**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  In fact Matisse, one of the photos of him in the Cone sisters' apartment, in Etta Cone's apartment, he is standing in front of it.  I think it was in her dining room and it was a picture that she really liked.  When he offered it to her, she was very concerned about the fish that you see here on the beach, and whether they were alive, whether this was a still life of still alive item or not.  And he assured her that he had paid a little boy from town to water them, so that, once he was done, he could throw them back into the water, which made her feel much better about a painting like this.

**Matisse on painting landscapes**

Henri Matisse:  In painting a landscape, you choose it for certain beauties, spots of color, suggestions of composition.  Close your eyes and visualize the picture, then go to work, you are representing the model or any other subject, not copying it.

**Odalisques**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again, is Katherine Rothkopf of the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Henri Matisse:  The Odalisques where the bounty of a happy nostalgia, a lovely vivid dream.  And the almost ecstatic enchanted days and nights of the Moroccan climate.  One corresponding common vision with some leverage in the color.  I felt an irresistible need to express that ecstasy, that divine unconcern in corresponding colored rhythms, rhythms of sunny and lavish figures and colors.

Katherine Rothkopf:  The term Odalisque refers to a sort of romantic idea about a harem girl in the Middle East.  That's really where it came from as a way to paint beautiful interiors, starting in the nineteenth century.  And I think, for Matisse, he went to Morocco in 1912 or 1913 after having seen his first exhibition of Islamic art in Germany in 1910.  And he loved this idea of the sort of romantic exotic life that had been depicted in art for at least a hundred years.  When he actually went to Morocco, he found that it was really hard to get into anywhere, where he would see anything.  And so he had a hard time finding models, and he ended up doing more landscapes there than he ever intended.  The Odalisques in his career provided him with a little bit of fantasy.  He had wonderful models in Nice, who could really play with him and I think for him it provided a way to show great beauty and sensuality or color, texture and pattern in his very beautiful gem like paintings.

**Seated Odalisque, Left Knee Bent, Ornamental Background and Checkerboard**

Katherine Rothkopf:  The Seated Odalisque left knee bent is filled with so many textures and so many patterns.  The figure is so beautifully painted.  It's really one of the most extraordinary Odalisques in our collection I think and one of the most beautiful ones he ever made.  What I love so much is in really all of Matisse's Odalisques, he has these French girls sort of dressing up in costume.  And he was collecting these costumes from trips out of the country, and he was the one who is buying many of these things, whether it be the little purple jacket or the green pantaloons.  And he would always say that his models were great partners in this, they would work together and find poses together and really try to make the most compelling and interesting combinations that they could.  The way that her pantaloon sort of draped mirror a little bit of what's going on with the curtain behind.

And I love those organic shapes combined with the more sort of regular and rhythmic shapes that we see on the flooring and in the wallpaper behind.  And one of Matisse's favorite models in the 1920s was a woman named Harriet, who had been a dancer and was also interested in painting and she worked for Matisse for quite a few years.  And actually became great friends with his daughter, Marguerite, Harriet was a great partner for Matisse in coming up with these great poses.  And you know, because of her training as a dancer she had great stamina.  Matisse would make his models stand for very long periods of time so you really had to be quite strong to be able to serve as a model for him.  The left knee bent with the checkerboard, in that painting, we get so much information in such a relatively small painting, it's a wonderful thing.  We have the still life of the lemons and some sort of a cup and a plate and then a checkerboard.

And here, this one may feel somewhat more authentic than what it may be to be in a harem in his mind, because he has taken out all the furniture.  She is sitting I guess on the floor or something very low, that we can quite see.  There aren't so many visual clues that link her back to modern time and she is a modern day women of 1928 in Nice.  And I think the other two, the nude reflecting in the mirror and left leg bent may make it feel a little bit more like they are in a set.

**Standing Odalisque Reflected in a Mirror**

Female Speaker:  Odalisque reflected in a mirror is a marvelous work where he is really playing with this idea of mirroring, where you are getting to see Harriet who I believe is the model for this picture, from two sides.  You are a model of what we really are you nearing where your bank – he already at labeling them all here.  I often use nearing the end you trying to add and provide him with great device of showing how someone looks from five leading the realistic reflection contained other times replying with shape and form a different way with you about this.  He has our interest with her hand and public effort is great looking necklace of mine you he is checkered chair and back combined with cursor, short, bald, you should couldn't be more French of the idea that she would be a Moroccan woman I know she looks so friends.  It doesn't have to be authentic.  It just needs to work for him in and work for the resolution of the painting that save a little combination of reality and fantasy technologies is an.

**Matisse's upbringing in northern France**

Katherine Rothkopf:  Where Matisse was born in France in the Northern part of France was so well known for its textile industry.  He grew up in a very small town and wasn't really exposed to museums in art paintings in the way we think of them.  The art that he saw growing up really was based more on technical design.  Many of his relatives and neighbors were making beautiful textiles in the towns of Bowan and Lacato [Phonetic] [0:00:27].  And in fact starting in the late nineteenth century, those weavers and textile designers were providing their wares to the great fashion houses in Paris.  And Matisse always has this love for textiles and collected little pieces of things throughout his life. And when he moved to Nice in the teens, he brought down trunks full of things he had collected and he continued to collect.

**"Large Reclining Nude" sculpture**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again, is Jay Fisher, Deputy Director for Curatorial Affairs at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Jay Fisher:  So the large reclining nude in many ways is one of Matisse's most ambitious sculptures of large scale, beginning it in 1922 and finishing it in 1929.  There are comments from family and people that visited just wondering if he was ever going to finish it.  It starts at a period when Matisse was again very interested in the reclining nude subject.  He had kind of dropped it for a while, what motivated him to take it up again was in Nice, the museum there had a plaster cast of Michelangelo's great Medici Tome, with the two sculptures, night and day on either side of the tomb, and Matisse was fascinated with that.  In fact, he had been fascinated with it much earlier in his life when he actually had traveled to Florence and seen the actual tomb.  Not unlike, some of the earlier sculptures like The Serpentine, it started as a more solid model kind of figure and then what we see in the final result is that it almost looks like Matisse took a large, knife and began to slice off part of the figure, almost redisplaying instead of model volume.

So she gets much more severe and structured.  The other thing that I feel so strongly when I look at the sculpture is again, the tension.  I mean it makes my back ache to look at it.  How could a model have possibly held that pose and probably not for very long, at a certain point? I think he leaves the model behind and the sculpture takes on its own structure, but you feel the tension in the torso and of the tension of the muscle.  As you walk around you also see the twisting of the sculpture and the twisting of the limb, but it's also very solid and you feel every ounce of weight that the sculpture actually have.

Male Speaker 1:  For tips on viewing this ambitious sculpture in the way Matisse intended, select the green button.  Press the red button to hear Matisse describe the process of envisioning a sculpture in his mind.  Press the yellow button to enjoy a French cabaret song.

**Tips for viewing this sculpture**

Jay Fisher:  This is a wonderful sculpture, which the viewer really needs to move around to see it, and Matisse liked to photograph it from straight on and from one side or the other or from the back.  A wonderful indication of how again he saw our ability to view a figure as evolving and changing, as you walk around it.  It takes routes that you never would've expected as the sculpture almost unfolds for you walking around it, it's not predictable.

**Matisse on envisioning sculpture in the mind**

Henri Matisse:  To one's work, one must bring knowledge, much contemplation of the model or other subject and the imagination to enrich what one sees.  Close your eyes and hold the vision and then do the work with your own sensibility.  If it be a model, assume the pose of the model yourself, where the strain comes, it's the key of the movement.

**"Interior, Still Life with Parakeets"**

Male Speaker 1:  Once again, here is the MIA's Erika Holmquist-Wall.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  This was actually Claribel and Etta's favorite picture.  And I think his painting really expresses Matisse's wonderful appetite for color and ornament.  You got it all in this painting.  He visited Nice every winter and he would take a different hotel room or an apartment every year.  So he was moving around and then just kind of setting up his props and wherever he landed.  So we really don't have any idea if his wonderful cinnamon-colored tiles were really so vivid, if they were such a bright red or if the bird cage really, if that brass really shown so brightly, if the patterns on the wallpaper or on the fabrics, were they really as large and decorative as they appear to be.  But the Matisse's reality on canvas and it takes us into a completely different world even if you place yourself there in the painting.  Can you imagine those little birds just squawking and chitter-chattering away?  Having a cup of tea with those little birds talking to you.

A visitors' recollection of being in Matisse's studio gives insight into how the artist took liberty with reality, press the red button to hear more.  To hear Matisse explain how he composes harmonious paintings, choose the yellow button.

**Understanding the painting's composition**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Interior flowers and parakeets is a view of the studio in the Matisse's third apartment in Nice.  When we look at the painting we see an elaborate Moorish curtain, Moorish mini-North African, Islamic Africa with gold lining that it's actually been pulled aside to reveal a second light filled studio space beyond.  And in the front room there we see a wooden table, he has laid it out with one of his favorite textiles, we see a shiny gold bird cage, there's two lime green parrots sitting in there, a cup and a saucer.  There are two lemons and this wonderful little cloud of pink flowers and a pretty little vase.  And in the back studio, you see a beautiful red Persian rug spread out on to this red vibrant red tiled floor, cinnamon colored floor and it leads to a floral screen that's actually placed in front of a green couch that Matisse used to pose his models.  And even further beyond through the window, you see the blue sky and the pale whitewashed buildings of the town below.

**A visitor's recollection of Matisse's studio**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  A visitor comes to Matisse's studio in the 1920, he is familiar with Matisse's paintings, he is excited to see the apartment that inspires his work.  He recognizes the window, the rug, the chairs, and even the vases, but he was shocked at how cluttered and small the room actually was.  And he realizes that, that is, it's Matisse's genius.  So he uses the paint and brush to give the room its soul, to give it, to give its light, to give it its color, it all comes from him.  So no matter, you know no matter where he's lived, no matter how common place his living quarter is, he is able to look at a setting or an object, a model sitting in a chair with completely fresh eyes.  He is able to surround himself with color and pattern and creating these places, these rooms that seem magnificently alive.  They are animated, there is lively pattern, they are glowing with color.

**Matisse on composing harmonious paintings**

Henri Matisse:  The entire arrangement of my pictures is expressive.  The place occupied by the figures, the empty spaces around them, the proportion, all of that has its share.  In a picture, every part will be visible and will play it appointed role.  Everything that is not useful in a picture is harmful.  A work of art must be harmonious in its entirety.  Any superfluous detail would replace some other essential detail in the mind of the spectator.

**"The Yellow Dress"**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again is Katherine Rothkopf, Curator of European painting and sculpture at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Katherine Rothkopf:  The yellow dress is certainly one of my favorite paintings in the collection.  Throughout the 20s, he painted many of these interiors with models in costume or in dresses.  He started painting in 1929, worked on it for a little while and it just wasn't working for him.  So he took a break, he went on a trip to Tahiti, a place he had always wanted to go.  And was there for a few months and really loved the flora and the light and the beauty of Tahiti.  He came back from that experience, worked on her a little bit more, but it still wasn't quite there and wasn't quite satisfied.  Finally, in 1931, he returned for the final time and finally finished it.  It turns out she is sort of the end of this great period of Nice interiors for him.  He then takes this three year break for making easel paintings and worked from the barn's mural and worked from his first illustrated book.

So we can really look to her signaling the end of the 1920s Odalisque interiors and the beginning of the next period in his career.  What's so great about that painting is that Matisse has left so much of his exploration right on the canvas, you can see it through the Pentimenti that comes up through the paint.  When he started the painting, she was certainly in a central position, but she was smaller.  She becomes more monumental, her shoulders become larger, her arms have changed and she really becomes much more of a commanding figure as time moved on.  And the sense of light and harmony between light and color and pattern is so beautifully articulated in this painting.  It really is the culmination of a whole decade's worth of work.

By the time he was done, it is though she is a flower sort of coming out of her shell, much like the sculpture Venus in a shell, that's also in the exhibition.  And I think when she started off, she seemed a little coquettish or too youthful or not serious enough and I think in the end, she becomes this very monumental, a very strong figure.  And I think maybe he was waiting for that to happen.

Male Speaker 1:  To hear about a surprise, Matisse arranged for his friend and avid collector Etta Cone, press the green button.  Select the red button to learn about the details in this painting that illustrate changes Matisse made as he reworked it.  Press the yellow button to hear Matisse in his own words reflect upon his attempts to finish this painting over many years.

**Matisse's surprise from Etta Cone**

Katherine Rothkopf:  Etta loved this painting.  When she came to visit Matisse in 1932 I believe, he didn't have any other paintings and so he reluctantly sold it to her and she was absolutely thrilled.  In the next summer she came back for her annual visit to Nice to see her old friend and to see what was available.  And he really didn't have any other paintings to offer her, so he decided as a treat, that he would have the model come back and pose for her as a gift, a tableau vivant as a gift for his greatest patron of the time.

Etta Cone:  My visit to Matisse was a joy; he said I have a surprise for you.  And presently I turned and there sat the model in the yellow taffeta dress with the large yellow hat on, just in front of the window, the exact reproduction of my latest painting.  His bedroom, which is his studio when he is well, was the scene of this picture.  Needless to say, I was thrilled.

Katherine Rothkopf:  No, it really meant so much to her that he was taking the trouble to do something so special.

**How this painting evolved over a decade**

Katherine Rothkopf:  Certainly the first thing to look at is the figure of the model, look at the changes that you can see very clearly, the change in the shoulder, particularly to your right, the way he has put her hands together.  She is sort of cuddling herself, making this beautiful form.  There is sort of a harmony to her figure that even though we can see how she's changed, if you look in her face very clearly, you can see that her eyes have moved in their original spot.  And this is the part of growth that must have taken place, like a plant getting bigger.  I love the underside of her hat with the sort of green that comes through so clearly combined with the yellow.

And really even the dress, you know we call it the yellow dress, but it certainly is not made out of a lot of yellow, plain flat yellow paint.  It's filled with color and shadow throughout it, and so carefully and beautifully painted.  What's also fun is to look at this red tile, which appears in many of his other paintings.  This is his studio, this is where he lived in Nice and the red tile floors that gives you that sort of geometric pattern combined with her organic shape.  It just makes her very beautiful and a pleasing combination.  To the right of her figure, you see these yellow orange shutters that have this great texture and intensive geometry and then what looks to be a curtain perhaps in the blue and then the wallpaper or some sort of a texture on the wall to the far left.

Wallpaper, window, shutters, curtains, window and more wallpaper, it's just absolutely beautiful and plays with the sense of color and some very geometric shapes, against much more organic shape and it really just makes for a beautiful background.  For Matisse, to get the color right, to get the combination say in the wallpaper, where we have all sorts of colors, purples and greens and reds and black, he really wants it to be so right and he just kept doing it over and over again.  And it's hard to say why this pleased him more than what he did a week earlier and we of course don't know what it looked like a week earlier in his creative process.

But he loved the idea of combining cool and warm colors together, because it sort of gives a visual energy and it makes, when you look at it, you may not even be aware of it, but it does sort of give you a little charge.  And I think for him getting it just right and pushing himself until he was complete, was something he did over and over again.  And I think it's just marvelous.

**Matisse on the challenge of finishing "The Yellow Dress"**

Henri Matisse:  In my Nice studio before my departure for Tahiti, I had worked several months on the yellow dress without finishing it.  And during my trip, even while strongly impressed by what I was seeing everyday I often thought of the work I had left unfinished. Might I even say that I thought of it constantly.  Returning to Nice for a month this summer, I went back to the painting and worked on it every day.  Then I left again for America and during the crossing, I realized what I had to do, there is a weakness in the construction of my painting and its possible resolution.

**"Large Reclining Nude" painting**

Male Speaker 1:  Katherine Rothkopf of the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Henri Matisse:  Dear Mademoiselle Cone, I'm sending you some photographs representing various states of work in progress, the states of a painting.  Reclining nude, the dates of the different states are indicated on the photos.  I hope that these different works gives you a little amusement and my goal will be realized.  September 1935, Nice.

Katherine Rothkopf:  When Matisse came to Baltimore in 1930 and saw the collection, you know he saw the Blue Nude for the first time in many years.  And when he returned to easel painting, after taking that three-year break, after he finished the Yellow Dress, he did the mural, he did his first illustrated book and then he came back to painting.  And the following year he starts to work on the large Reclining Nude as, I feel very strongly, a response to having seen the Blue Nude for the first time in many, many years.  He started thinking about her and thinking about his style, his new sense of lyricism and light and color and pattern that was so different.  And by that point he knew, Etta's great interest in him as a fully creative artist, she was interested in his paintings, his sculptures, his drawings, his prints and he had come to the Cone apartment and he had seen what she had that and so he really, I believe, painted this painting for her.  And so he sent her two letters with the photographs and she certainly could not have resisted it and she bought it the next year.

Male Speaker 1:  What's going on with the sense of space and proportion in this painting, press the green button to hear from Jay Fisher of the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Matisse exhaustively documented his own creative process as he worked on this painting, to hear Erika Holmquist-Wall of the MIA explain, select the red button.  For Matisse's thoughts on creating harmonious relationships between colors, press the yellow button.

**Space and Proportion**

Jay Fisher:  You really wanted this painting to hang near the Blue Nude and that's just exactly how Etta chose to put it.  She put the Blue Nude on one wall and on the opposite wall; she put the Large Reclining Nude.  Here we have a flattened figure, where the pain doesn't really seem to have any articulation in terms of space.  It looks like a flat color that's just painted in the same lightness and darkness all the way through.  And it almost looks like this nude is collaged or glued on the blue crisscrossed couch that she must be lying on, that's all flattened out as well.  So we have the flat nude, the flattened couch above her, we see a chair, actually a chair with her curly back, bouquet of flowers sitting on the seat of the chair.  And even that is all flattened out together with a white tile wall, green lines in between the tile.

So we see a kind of progression of flattened surfaces, but when you see it all together, you kind of read in the volume of her figure, and she doesn't really.  She looks flat, but you know she's not; she's actually the only thing along with the flower I think above her that carries some volume.  Matisse sets up this wonderful linear balance, she just inhabits that space so perfectly and when she gets a little, you know too big, then Matisse just cuts off, cuts off the hand, cuts off leg and the other foot and the knee.  So she has to fit within that tight space which makes us feel like she is very much compressed there and almost like a spring.  You could imagine her just kind of bursting out of that space.  Matisse is often interested in suggesting a kind of tension and there is a tension in the way that her body is stretched out.

The other thing that's so small of course is her head, her head just looks miniature and as we look at the progressive photograph, she at one period had a much bigger head and Matisse just kept reducing it and reducing it.  And just getting to the essence of what he wanted.  This Reclining Nude is much different than the reclining nudes of 1907, but yet, it's been totally transformed by a new way of looking.

**Matisse's documentation of his creative process**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Actually I have this amazing collection of photographs that he had sent to Etta Cone documenting the evolution of this painting.  I think she actually purchased the work because he did send her the documentary photographs of the working process and the letter.  He chose to send them to her.  When you look at the photographs, really notice how he takes the time to experiment with pulling something out, putting something back in, eliminating a feature and then rethinking that and simplifying it.  It sheds light on his work in process and his thinking, you know she starts out as this very sort of conventional, traditional women on a coach, she is anatomically correct.

There is a vase of flowers and all the sudden her shape, it just starts to shift and morph and change into something else entirely, it's slightly recognizable from the first date.  But his work in process and what it took to get there, and the fact that he documented.  He realized he was doing something very important here, he realized he was capturing something.  In photo number nine, all of a sudden he's inlaid these lines and stripes behind the body and five days later, now they are tiles.  Two months later, they are blacked out again, a month later, they are added and the still life becomes completely unrecognizable with a sort of biomorphic shape hovering above it.  She's monumental, but she is still elegant, she is completely streamlined.  His striped everything away.  It's like he's pushing towards this entirely new symbolic language.

**Matisse on relationships between colors**

Henri Matisse:  Suppose I have to paint an interior, I have before me a cupboard.  It gives me a sensation of vivid red and I put down a red that satisfies me.  A relation is established between this red and the white of the canvas.  Then we put a green near the red and make the floor yellow and again there would be relationships between the green or the yellow and the white of the canvas which will satisfy me.  I'm forced to transpose until finally my picture makes it completely changed.  From the relationships I found in old times, that must result in a living harmony of colors, a harmony analogous to that of a musical composition.

**"Purple Robe and Anemones"**

Male Speaker 1:  Here is exhibition curator, Erika Holmquist-Wall.

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  Purple robe and Anemones is one of my personal favorite.  Its 1937, his model at the time that he is working with Lydia Delectorskaya.  I think Matisse really conveys his ability and genius to take great liberties with reality.  He believes that taking liberties with reality, allows him to convey the essence of his subject.  There is so much in this painting that is, it seems to be fighting against each other, but it all works.  This painting is indulgent with color and pattern, the stripes, the wavy lines, the pattern tiles.  Everything is much larger than life; he expands everything and just goes for it.  He takes a total delight in just combining these colors and patterns that normally you wouldn't even think of going together.

He intensifies the colors to make them sing and they work even though they are not considered compatible.  She is slightly distorted, you can't tell what she is sitting on, as you can see her legs or her knees: Is she squatting? Is she kneeling? Is she sitting?  It's about – it's not even about the figure.  She's not even like a flesh and blood person, there is no anatomy here, she's just a very pleasing decorative shape, as part of the environment.  We see the top of the table and we see the sides all at once.  It's just as if something; somebody has taken a giant weight or a hammer and squashed this entire scene into a flat, two-dimensional space.  There is no foreground, there is no background, it's all completely unified into one's airless space and that's what really causes you to focus on the color and the pattern.

You are not focused on space anymore.  Which is interesting, because you think about his late career and the cutouts and the flat shapes, this is almost the next step before he kind of takes that leap into the pure, clean, simple lines of paper cutouts.  I mean, this really shows his sense of freedom in being able to reinvent.

Male Speaker 1:  To learn about Matisse's return to familiar subjects with this painting press the green button.  Select the red button to hear Matisse describe his insatiable impulse to create.  Press the yellow button to hear some French music.

**Return to familiar painting subjects**

Erika Holmquist-Wall:  The human figure in still life, he returns to them again and again and again throughout his career.  And he uses them as a springboard to experiment with fundamentals of shape, of color, of line, composition, weight, volume.  Look at the wavy lines on the wallpaper; how they pick up the wavy lines on the pewter jug and on her rob.  The straight bold stripes on the gray carpet and how they echo the stripes on the wallpaper in the back, how the black dots on her necklace pick up the buttons on her coat and the black centers of the anemones.  It's so quintessentially Matisse, he is working very, very hard to make something look very simple and very easy.  I think it's like a transition point; he is evolving into something, else entirely.

**Matisse on the impulse to create**

Henri Matisse:  You understand now why I am never bored.  For over fifty years, I have not stopped working for an instant.  From nine o'clock to noon, first sitting, then I have a little nap and take up my brushes again at two in the afternoon until the evening.  You won't believe me, on Sundays, I have to tell all sorts of tales to the models.  I promised them that it's the last time I will ever beg them to come and pose on that day.  Naturally, I pay them double.  Finally, when I sense that they are not convinced, I promise them a day off during the week.  Mr. Matisse one of them answered me, this has been going on for months and I never had one afternoon off.  Poor things, they don't understand.  Nevertheless, I can't sacrifice my Sundays for them merely because they have boyfriends.

**Never Again**

[French Music].

**"Jazz"**

Male Speaker 1:  Here again is Jay Fisher, Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Jay Fisher:  Jazz is a marvelous book, certainly one of Matisse's greatest efforts.  And he worked with a wonderful publisher and editor.  His name was Tériade, and Tériade had a way of working with books, which he felt brought out the best possible collaboration with an artist.  He really expected the artist to come up with the subject for the book.  He and Matisse were very interested in not doing a book about jazz as music, but kind of picking up the flavor and the movement and the color that jazz suggests.  And instead of choosing an author that Matisse might have worked with, what Tériade frequently did, he asked his artist to write out the text himself.  And so the text is written by Matisse and actually written out, we get the wonderful flow of Matisse's penmanship.  And in that Matisse talks about jazz music and he also talks about the circus, his mind really wanders over a number of topics that don't specifically go to explaining the illustrations in the book, but sort of evoke the whole feeling of color and movement as you go through the book.

Male Speaker 1:  To learn about Matisse's return to the familiar subjects with his painting press the green button.  Select the red button to hear Matisse describe his insatiable impulse to create.  Press the yellow button to hear some French music.

**Collaborative process**

Jay Fisher:  In the very beginning we see a circus banner called silk [Phonetic] [0:00:05] and we see the woman on a trapeze swinging back and forth with the banner in the space around her.  One of my favorite plates comes early on, an elephant balancing on a ball.  It has a yellow background; the ball has the blue star right in the middle of it.  And this is really a very kind of poignant illustration because I think Matisse, like many artists, much as they loved the circus, that sometimes they were worried about the mistreatment and the humiliation really of the animal.  The very idea of putting such a magnificent creature as an elephant with enormous weight and making them balance that way, hoofs raised in the air on a ball as they roll it across a ring.  It's just you know a horrible thing to contemplate.

I think the red flashes that we see really communicate to us the kind of wounding and humiliation of that creature.  We see someone riding the horse with a decorative costume in black light.  And then you see the whip coming out from the other side of the circus master, the ringmaster whipping the horse to get it to move and prance around the ring.  There's all the beauty and the fun, the audience and the excitement, the colors of the circus, but still this other side of it.  Come a little farther along, where you see two shapes that look like a kind vase for flowers, but actually they are two torso and they reflect the cutting of pieces of paper, which Matisse undertook to create the model from which the plates and the book are made.  So first you see a blue surrounding a gray shape, that's of the torso.  And then as you go to the next illustration, you see the blue shape, so actually the thing that he cut out from the blue paper.  So it appears as a positive shape against the negative of the gray, so he has reversed the relationship.

Henri Matisse:  The cutouts are not a new departure, but a conclusion.  They arose as if from a spring with a trial and error.  They were a long time in the making, developing in secret, perhaps they had already beckoned me.

**Drawing with scissors**

Jay Fisher:  When one looks at Matisse's, the span of his career, one sees him working with similar subjects and seeing things in a new and more simplified, refined, synthesized way.  In his later years he experienced abdominal cancer, this was very serious problem for him health wise and he had an operation which wasn't entirely successful and that it damaged his abdominal muscle.  So for a period, it was very difficult for Matisse to stand up at an easel and paint.  So he was forced really to work in bed and he could still draw in bed.  He could draw on the walls around him in his bedroom but taking a long stick and putting a piece of crayon right at the end of the stick and reaching out from his bed and drawing a figure on the wall.  And the other thing that he began to do was to have his studio assistant help him paint large pieces of paper with wonderful colors that he would choose.

And then he would sit in his bed with a big pair of very sharp scissors and he would cut out the shape, whether they were figures or animals, but mostly really figures.  And in the process of doing this, it almost as if he was drawing in color.  So you could imagine he was using the scissors like a drawing tool as he went through these colorful sheets of paper and cutout shapes.  Then when he had a large group of various shapes, then he would collage them, he would glue them down to sheets of colored paper.  So you would see a black figure maybe with a red heart against a blue ground and some yellow stars.  The necessity of his health problem required him to adopt a new way of drawing really.  In a certain way the cutouts bring all the aspects of his art together.  They bring shape together with color, they bring line together with volume.  It's as if he synthesized the experience of looking at a figure and has reduced it to the most simple element.  So it's just a pure expression of those formal goals he had in his art all of life.

Henri Matisse:  What I was trying to do with these paper cutouts was to rediscover through unusual technical means, the lovely days of line and color to wring out of them, the resonance and concurrence of a new freshness.

**Collage to printed book**

Jay Fisher:  Once he had created these cutout, which we would almost call cutout [Indiscernible] [0:00:12] for all the place in the book.  He then commissioned these professional print makers who knew how to make what are called [Indiscernible] [0:00:23] print.  Matisse wanted to make his single cutout into something that could be reproduced in a number of copies.  So his challenge was how did he carry forward the feeling of these cutout collages into a printed book and these amazing craftsman were able to cuts stencils and then brush on the color coming very close to what Matisse's original colors were and to print them in such a way that it really looks like they too are collages.  We are looking at an actual cutout rather than a print made from a cutout.  And I think there is something like 250 copies of this book.

Henri Matisse:  Each picture as I finish it, it seems like the best thing I have ever done.  And then after a while I am not so sure.  It's like taking a train to Masse, one knows where ones wants to go, each painting completed is like a station, just so much near the goal.  The time comes when the painter is up to feel, yes at least arrived.  Then if he is an artist, he realizes one of two things, either that he has not arrived after all or that Masse is not where he wanted to go anyway and he must push further on.
