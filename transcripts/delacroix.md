Kaywin Feldman: Eugène Delacroix was an engine of revolution.  He used color and emotion to transform French painting in the 19th century and he helped to define modern art.

Delacroix was extremely influential to the artists of his time and those that came after, especially the Impressionists.  This exhibition presents unique opportunity to see artwork by Delacroix with paintings and drawings by the artists he inspired including Cézanne, Monet and Van Gogh.  Their art creates a visual conversation of color, style, content and form.

On this tour, you will hear insights from curators, conservators and contemporary artists as you get to know Delacroix as an artist and a person.

I am Kaywin Feldman, Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Director  & President, of Minneapolis Institute of Art.  I am pleased to welcome you to Mia on our 100th year.  Please enjoy your visit to _Delacroix's Influence: The Rise of Modern Art, from Cézanne to Van Gogh_.

Eric Bruce:  Here is Patrick Noon, Elizabeth MacMillan Chair of Paintings at the Minneapolis Institute of Art and Head Exhibition Curator.

Patrick Noon:  To me this is a portrait of an artist where everything is laid bare.  It was painted around 1850 so it was at the height of his powers, his notoriety and his creative genius.  He was about 52 years old at the time.

He was very much a social creature that he went to salons regularly, he became very close friends with Chopin and George Sand and attended their salons.  Salons were the way of socializing in the 19th century and he was very much a part of that culture, he didn't like it and he didn't stay very long at these things, but he went.  And he was always very reserved apparently from what people say.  When he made a comment, everybody listened but he was never trying to take the center stage, he was just there to observe basically and then he would go home and he'd work.  He'd work until the middle of the night.

He never married because work was his spouse and he admitted that.  I can't be distracted, I have to do this.  At the end of his life which is what we are mostly dealing with the work from last years of his life, he was very reclusive, because he knew he was running out of time, where he felt that he had too little time to accomplish what he wanted to accomplish.

Eric Bruce:  If you would like to hear what George Sand, writer and dear friend of Delacroix wrote about him two days after his death, press the Green button.



**1G**

Patrick Noon:  And George Sand writes a very interesting letter to a friend of hers and they were very close friends Delacroix and George Sand.

And Sand writes that, literally two days after Delacroix's death, she writes to a mutual friend of theirs and remembers going to visit him in his studio.  She said, "We'd go in and he'd be in there and he'd be huddled and he would have a scarf wrapped around his neck and he would spend an hour or so telling us of all his ailments. And then suddenly out of the blue, he'd throw off the scarf and he'd jump up and he exclaimed as though he were 20 years old and he'd show us all these sketches he was doing and he'd come to life basically.  He would barely let us leave."

In her words he returned to that youthful bon vivant, energetic artist a person that everyone knew him to be, who knew him personally.

Eric Bruce:  Christopher Riopelle is the curator of post-1800 paintings at the National Gallery in London and co-curator of this exhibition.

Christopher Riopelle:  Music in the Tuileries Gardens was Manet's very, I think, conscious attempt to paint a new kind of history painting that's really modern painting in which he assembles all of his friends in the Tuileries Garden in the middle of Paris and just show them enjoying a pleasurable day.

Many of the people in this picture would know Delacroix, he was still alive at this point.  Delacroix himself isn't in the picture, he was a rather grand and isolated figure by that point.  Manet is on the far left in a top hat looking right at us, very handsome man.  And it is as if he is our guide to this.

Interestingly the picture is called Music in the Tuileries Gardens, but amusingly there is no sign of music whatsoever.

With the title Manet has given us a hint, but visually he doesn't then expand on it.

One of the revolutionary aspects of the picture I would say, all across the picture and it's a wide picture there are equal points of interest and that starts on the far left with Manet himself, he is seen there with a group of friends including the painter Fantin-Latour.  Moving along you see the poet Baudelaire, the most important art critic of the day.  The composer Offenbach. You see near the center of the picture, Manet's own brother who is leaning over to speak to some women.  At the end of the day it is an invention but one that we have to believe could have been true.  Manet and his artistic and poetic and musical friends would have been considered bohemian at that time and yet to us they don't look at all like bohemians.  They are wearing top hats, they are wearing frock coats, they look infinitely respectable and yet a Parisian in 1862 looking at that picture would understand that these were bohemians living on the edge of society, we don't have the same code for reading it as someone in 1862 would have.

Christopher Riopelle: I think formally it thrust the history of art forward in the two ways we have been talking about: one, by the absolute refusal to impose a hierarchy of meaning on it. That you see meaning all across this very wide canvas.  Secondly, in the very definite use of color without modulation, the boldness with which the paint is applied, the almost caricatural way in which he portrays some of the characters. And then finally in its absolute commitment to paint modern life, which had not been as it were an acceptable subject for high art before this time.

There was, I think, right from the late 1850s a sense in the Paris art world that something had to give. That French art was getting rather boring and it needed a kick in the behind.  And Manet, even though he certainly did not set out to do that, became the person who administered the kick.

The reason the piece is in the show is that it shows the world of art in Paris at the moment Delacroix dies, I mean this is 1862; Delacroix dies a year later in 1863.  And what it's saying is that in those final years of Delacroix's life, a new art world was in the process of emerging.

It would change everything, but then as we will see in the whole second half of the exhibition, Delacroix continued to play a big role in that changed world, more than any other artist of the older generations, it was Delacroix to whom all these young art rebels would keep turning back and finding things.  It's the transitional picture, the turning point picture in the whole exhibition.

Patrick Noon: Around the same times as the self-portrait that we just looked at Delacroix was commissioned with probably the most important commission of his life, not that it was the largest, but it was probably the most important, because it was the central panel of the Gallery of Apollo in the Musée du Louvre.  It's a panel that had been left unpainted, unfinished or unfilled with any kind of subject for over 200 years.  And it was his job to go in and try to paint a subject that was going to compete with all this Baroque decoration around it from the 17th century.  And he was terrified, but he studied Italian ceiling painting very closely for what he could.

So he choose a story from Ovid's _Metamorphosis,_ the ancient Roman writer's great poem of the gods.  And the subject is Apollo slaying the python.  According to Ovid's _Metamorphosis_ Jupiter had basically tried to destroy mankind and then realized that in doing so he gave rise to all these monsters who would probably finish the job.  So instead, in an act of mercy, he sends all of his minion gods down to earth to slay all these monsters.  And Apollo was assigned the worst of them which was the great python.  And what Delacroix shows in the swirl of sunlight and Apollo in his chariot coming out of this brilliant sunlight (he was after all the sun god) shooting python down below and surrounded by the other gods and other vignettes destroying other monsters.

The sketch which we have in the show mimics the final composition and there is only two sketches known for this final ceiling which gives you an idea, a sense of how Delacroix worked. Once he sort of banged out this sketch, he knew what he was going to do, he just went and did it.

Eric Bruce:  How does Delacroix create such energy in his paintings? Press the Green button to find out.

**3G**

Patrick Noon: You see in the sketch how he composes, it's like almost instantaneous, it's like one go.  Everything gets painted quickly, everything is in balance but everything is put down really fast, there's no hesitation, there's no finishing parts, there's no doing this here in this corner, now I will go to this corner, it's all done in one fast put down of the composition which he's already thought out in his head.  And once he gets that down he can then move on and produce a larger picture, not as fast and he always writes about the fact that it's a shame that in finishing a picture you start to lose some of the energy you have in your preparatory work and the key is to try not to lose too much.

Patrick Noon: Redon was an artist, a symbolist painter, who very much admired Delacroix above all other artists and when he first arrived in Paris from the south of France, he would follow Delacroix around.  And Delacroix didn't know this but he would just, he would follow him and observe what he did.  And on occasion he would sit outside of Delacroix's studio just wait for him to come out so he could see him.  It was quite remarkable is that kind of idol worship and he wasn't alone in this, there were other artists who felt the same way or maybe perhaps not as extreme as this but we know about it because Redon writes about it in his memoires and his first encounter with Delacroix.  And then writes very cogently later about Delacroix's art, he says, he was the first artist who actually used color for expression, rather than definition or realism but it was for expressive color.  He was the first artist to really pick up on that and promote that idea in his own work.  And you see this is something like Pegasus, the greens the oranges, the yellows these are all Delacroix colors - used much more boldly than Delacroix ever used them but nonetheless that's where the power comes from.

At the end of Redon's life, he becomes very much interested in Delacroix's monster slaying pictures, you know there's Pegasus there's an Andromeda all these classical legends about the monster slayers and even the Christians ones the St. Michael and that sort of thing, these are all images that the symbolist especially artists like Redon picked up from Delacroix.

In the case of Pegasus, Redon actually says, this represents poetry in its purity in dominating envy which is represented by the serpent.  So he conceived it really as a variation on Delacroix's Apollo Slaying the Python.  Again as a metaphor for the ostracized artist triumphing over adversity and hostility from the establishment.

Patrick Noon: _The Convulsionists_ is a fantastic painting by Delacroix and it's probably the most important picture by him in North America.  We believe from what the Count de Mornay tells us much later that he and Delacroix had to view this procession of Sufi, this is a sect of Sufism called the Aissawaand every year the Sufi would parade themselves through the streets of Tangier on the way to the shrine of the founder of their sect.  And in the process of doing that they did what certain Sufi sects quite often do, they get into a trance state and that's what they are doing in this picture.  And Delacroix is trying to capture some of that movement and excitement and energy and violence.

According to the Comte de Mornay they had to witness this from an attic because they were afraid if they were seen they would be torn to pieces.  Not so much by the Sufi but by everyone else.  It was a very dangerous place to be for Europeans.  It certainly captures in this picture some of that dynamic.  It's a brilliance of the blue sky, it's the brilliance of the light hitting white washing these walls and reflecting off of those surfaces.  And then of course just the brilliant color, the natural brilliant color of the costumes, of the people in this part of the world.  These are all things that lead him to start seeing color in a different way.

What he is trying to do is express the color that he is seeing when he was there.  It was shocking to people to see this kind of clarity.  Many artists felt that they had to go south specifically to try to experience the color that Delacroix did in North Africa.

Van Gogh goes to the south of France, Monet does the same thing and then you have next door to us in this picture you have Renoir.

Eric Bruce:  Delacroix was the first French artist to go to North Africa, press the Green button to find out how he got there.

**5G**

Patrick Noon: The second phase of Delacroix's orientalism is actually 'The Experienced.'  In 1830 the French invaded North Africa, they invaded Algeria in response to the Barbary pirates.  They then decided to colonize North Africa.  So in 1832 Louis Philippe the King of France sent a diplomatic mission to Morocco to secure the support to a peace treaty with the Sultan of Morocco. The Comte de Mornay was the diplomat who was sent with an entourage and Delacroix was asked to go as his draftsman, really but I think Mornay just wanted him as a companion.

So Delacroix thought this was a fantastic opportunity and they spent six months in North Africa, mostly in Tangiers in Morocco.  While there, he created a huge number of water color drawings of the people, the landscape, the architecture. He was fascinated by the culture of North Africa he was fascinated by the natives who were mix Jewish and Arab decent.  And he viewed the inhabitance of Tangiers of North Africa as the true decedents of ancients, this is what they were like: tan, simply closed, very noble. This is how he saw inhabitants.

This was a very important moment in his life because he was one of the first French artists to actually travel the North Africa.  His early pictures certainly has certain cache of authenticity which greatly impressed contemporary French audiences who were not only impressed by shocked by what they were seeing, but also Delacroix's color schemes, he has experienced something quite dramatic, different from the leaden skies of Paris.

When he gets back to Paris, he paints three major pictures which he exhibits in the 1830s based on this experience.  The very first was the Women of Algiers in their Apartment, which we have a later version of in the show.  The second was The Jewish Wedding which we have a copy by Renoir at the beginning of our exhibition.  And then the third was the Convulsionists of Tangiers and it was acquired by one of our founders James J. Hill, who was in fact the most important collector of Delacroix in North America in the 19th century.

Patrick Noon: Renoir was one of the most important of Delacroix's admirers and he starts out painting imaginary Orientalist pictures, but then in 1881 he decides he needs to go to North Africa to really understand Delacroix's color.  He makes the pilgrimage to Tangiers and Algeria.  In this instance he paints an incredibly amazing painting of an Arab festival at the center of which are Sufi minstrels. And he must have gone to North Africa with these images in mind.  In this painting he is bordering on abstraction, it's just touches of color, it's a palette and a brilliance of palette that immediately harkens back to Delacroix.

In this particular Renoir, he is very much aware of that kind of movement and surface, it's just these touches of painting and color moving all over the surface, which you recognize as people but barely, which is creating a composition with movement and color not with drawing and not with linear exactitude or minute touches for detail, he is doing exactly what Delacroix does in his own way.

Patrick Noon: In _The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan_, he is actually illustrating and I don't think illustration is actually the appropriate word for this, but he imagining a particular couplet from Byron's verse. Byron writes:

When grappling in the fight they fold

Those arms that ne'er shall lose their hold:

Friends meet to part; Love laughs at faith;

True foes, once met, are joined till death!

So the confused and intense fury of this particular composition was exactly what recaptures from Byron's verse.  It's a remarkable picture.  He returns to the Giaour many times and he illustrates it to different passages but in this particular one he has really created the most energetic image of this poem, imaginable.  And he based it not just saw in this reading of the text but he has interpreted the text in such a way that it reflects an actual experience that he had in North Africa.

The Arabian horses that were used by the North African Cavalry were quite off rank and would attack each other.  These horses were so high strung they would throw their riders and caused chaos and essentially that's what you have here not just these two hostile enemies a Christian Giaour and an Arab sheikh Hassan going at each other.  The horses are also engaged in a life and death struggle.  And the Giaour and Hassan were deadly enemies because of Hassan's murdering the Giaour's mistress.  It's an extraordinary interpretation of Byron's play.

Patrick Noon: Romanticism is a movement throughout Europe unlike neoclassical painting in which narrative is meant to be virtuous, and technique was meant to be highly skilled and minute and carefully crafted so that the narrative can be clearly understood, all the virtues that the French felt were essential for great art were thrown out of the window by the Romantics.  They were interested in violence; they were interested in core emotions. One poet said, truth in nature is actually expressing what people are really about, it's not about what the ancients were about.  We're not ancients, our culture is modern, our social structures are different, our habits are more resolved, these are not those of the ancients, and the value of imitating the ancients is negligible in this day and age.

What we want to express is the truth of human nature as we see it, as it's lived today, as it's lived by the people who are around us.  You know you are trying to paint your experience and you are trying to invent ways of doing that, you are not following the standard conventional rules for learning how to paint.  The French academy had very, very strict rules how you learned to become an artist, it was still very much a craft mentality.  So it's all about control, all about technical control and expertise and developing it and learning that.  It was a very hierarchic system of teaching and a very hierarchic system of rewarding merit that didn't really allow for a promote or encourage individuality which is what Romanticism is all about, it's about the individual, it's not about some cultural construct about how we should behave because the ancients behaved this way.

Delacroix was very much of the opinion as most romantic artists were that you can't teach art, you can teach the mechanics of art but you are not producing great art.  Great art comes from the self.  So you have artists who are trying to be individual, trying to create technical means that are so different from what other artists were doing or using in order to be able to express themselves in highly original ways, that is what Modernism is all about.  And Modernism begins with Romanticism.

**7R**

Patrick Noon: The thing about Delacroix's compositions are I mean, he has a way of creating these explosive energized compositions of figures, movement, in ways that are completely balanced and actually pure genius.  And even his severest critics would say for all of his bad drawing and all of his inaccurate anatomical representation and all of his figures that look like they're rubber bands and it can't stand up, for all of that he is brilliant at creating this kind of intense movement within a composition in that it's that intense movement of course which is so expressive and expresses the nature of the subject and also his own inner inspiration.

The manner in which he executes a picture allows him to do that, because he is not doing it piecemeal, you know paint a head here, paint a foot there but he is going from one part of the canvas to the other at the same time; he is working the whole surface at once which is why his pictures look so rapidly drawn and quickly brushed, because he is, he is moving across the whole surface, which is what the Impressionist will do too because that's the aim of their approach, and Delacroix is of course the bridge.

Eric Bruce:  David Marquis is Chief Conservator and Senior Paintings Conservator at the Midwest Art Conservation Center.

David Marquis:  _The Arabs Skirmishing_ is a wonderful example of loose use of a narrative battle scene but really the story is about the painting and how the paint is applied and the expressive use of the color.  This is one of Delacroix's late if not last painting I think, and it really is a perfect illustration of how he used color differently.  Prior to Delacroix the Neoclassicists were using color mostly in a descriptive way.  The contour of the design was kind of primary.  And when Delacroix came along he begins to use color in a very different way; in a much more expressive way.  And instead of working one small area of the design at a time (which the Neoclassicist did, they would finish an area and then they would finish the next area) he started to work the whole surface at one time and create form with dabs of color rather than color and value blended smoothly one into another.

One of his really major contributions is to use simultaneous contrast which essentially means his belief that a color only exists in relation to its neighbor, that's the simplest way to say it.  For instance, if you wanted to make a dark color look lighter he would put a darker color next to it.  And if you look at his paintings particularly and you will see that illustrated in many different places in the design.

Another contribution and a different way of looking at a color is using color to create form and space rather than values.  Now by values I mean the Neoclassicist knew that light colors advance, dark color recede so if you look at a Neoclassical painting you will notice that to create volume and form they either add a tint (white) or they add black. Delacroix comes along and he starts using color to do this, the same thing, only he is using bright and dull and that brings a whole other dimension to painting.  He does the same thing in terms of warm and cool.  This is hard, hard to express, so generally speaking cool colors recede, warm colors advance, but also there is another dimension in that bright colors advance, dull colors recede.  So the closer a color is to a hue, true the primary color in the color wheel the more that color will advance.  So in other words you can make if you make the blue bright enough it will advance rather than recede being a cooler color considered a cooler color.

You have all these things working at the same time. What's really wonderful is you can take a color on your palette and put it on the painting and it looks completely different.  You can look at the two colors and go well they don't even look remotely the same and it's because the law of simultaneous contrast because a color is completely dependent on the color surrounding it and that's how we perceive it.

Eric Bruce:  The Green button will take you on a tour of Delacroix's techniques in this painting.

**8G**

David Marquis: Walk up close and you look at the horse for instance, and just look at all of the colors that the artist has used in defining and creating that horse.  There are not just tints and shades, there are many, many colors placed juxtaposed to each other to create that really deep luminous flesh tone of the horse.

He makes it look easy; he makes it look like he knocked this out in an hour.  But when you really start paying attention and looking at it close, you realize, oh my god this is very complex.  He doesn't want you to see that effort.  He wants that – he wants it to look like it just happened in moments.  And he happened upon this scene.

This is almost circular to me, I mean when I look at Arabs Skirmishing, I see a very circular, my eye goes like up to the blue of the sky down through the horses, up through the figures on the right side and just keeps going like this and your eye never rests.  It just keeps moving and I find that it's a lovely thing.  It's like this snapshot, frozen in time but the narrative continues, the action continues, and he is just taking a snapshot and it's all still happening, that's the feeling that I get when I look at it.

Eric Bruce:  Shana Kaplow is a visual artist based in the Twin Cities.  Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally.

Shana Kaplow:  My first impression looking at the painting was just how lush it is and how incredibly dappled the light is, which is for me really what takes me into the painting.  It's very, it's structured based on the movement of light through the room, this very lush, elaborately cushioned and patterned space.  It made me think about how soft it felt, like that there is a lot of layers of fabric, a lot of pattern, a lot of reflective light which I think is silk and gold thread in the fabrics, a gilded frame and reflective objects in the space.

I thought it was really interesting how he is using two different techniques to create light in the painting, one is with value which is the use of lights or whites in the painting but the other thing he is doing is a use of saturation or chroma.  So he is using really bright reds and yellows and blues and greens in the foreground to really move the light across the surface of the image.  So those rich colors which are higher saturated colors tend to make the light feel like it's glowing or that it's actually really illuminated.  It was pretty amazing to be able to make a painting that felt like light.  That it could emit light.

The surface of the painting holds that kind of brightness of light.  And then in the deeper spaces of the painting, he really pulls you in with this sort of reflected almost hints at things that you can't really tell what they are so that there is almost this cave like feeling in the back of the painting.  So he moves your eye across not only the surface of the painting but also pulls you back into the space and the sort of crevasses.  There is a circular kind of movement through the painting just following their gazes.  And it does really implicate the painter or who is now the viewer which is me or us.  I always tell my students that they are the viewer not just the painter.  So that that circle goes from inside the painting out to us and back into the painting.

There is a space in the back of the paining that feels very hidden from view, it's very dark, it's in the center of the painting and for me that's kind of a psychological space.  It means something more than just what we are seeing that it feels like it's about what can't be seen or what isn't supposed to be seen that there is something sort of rare and secret about that space.  But there is also this red closet door that's just barely open which to me is very suggestive.  Those red doors to me in the back are just very, you know it's like an innuendo almost.

Eric Bruce:  What did Delacroix experience being in a place that was off limits to western men?  The Green button will share Shana's insights.

**9G**

Shana Kaplow:  But the other thing that's interesting to me in the painting is that the women, first of all they are clothed, they are not posing for the viewer.  So they seem more self-possessed and in possession of their space and of their bodies.  Their clothing is really layered and they are protected from that voyeuristic gaze.  So I started to think that maybe it's the painter who is the uncomfortable one, being in the space, he was the outsider, he was the other.  I appreciate that, he gave it that quality, even though I think he also succumbed to some of the sort of norms of the time creating these sort of languishing scenes where women are kind of lying around.

But I have this great quote that, Delacroix wrote in his journal, it was from his experience there.  So he went there in 1832 and then made this painting, it's dated 1834.  So he made drawings and watercolors in the onsite, but then later constructed the painting.  So it's not a completely accurate rendition of what he saw but it's based on that experience.

So I thought what was interesting was he wrote, "The eye is truly dazzled by the bright light.  The fresh faces of the women and children amidst a mass of silk and gold.  For a painter it is a moment of fascination and strange happiness."  I thought that was so great because well for one, he is experiencing it very sensually.  He is in this one comment, at least he is responding to the light and the movement and the reflections and such and the material.

It was also interesting that he talks about the children that of course this is a space where women and children are living and it's very active and not that sort of languishing, sitting around smoking opium which of course there is an opium pipe there.  It also sort of reveals some of the construction that he put into the painting that's not accurate, you know, that he removed the children. He places the women in such a way that they seem to have nothing else to do, really, which I am sure is not really truthful, right.

Patrick Noon: Delacroix wrote later in life that he never did anything of any value with his orientalist experience until he had forgotten all the details and remembered only what was most poetic.  So you begin to see in his later work, these orientalist themes take on a much more imaginary imagery and they marry memory and imagination which are the two most important aspects of Delacroix's work that subsequent artist look to.

So in the case of _The Bathers_ this is the wonderful example of that idea, it's based on an experience which he had in North Africa.  This painting was done in 1854, so 20-some years after his North African experience.  He and the Comte de Mornay were out in the countryside outside of Tangiers and they came upon two women, two Arab women who were washing clothes, and one of the women decided in their presence to disrobe and take a bath which of course was so against all mores etc, so it was a provocation.

These guys the Mornay and Delacroix and their guide were just mesmerized of course and then the cavalry came over the hill, the Arab gentleman who were supposedly minding these women, started shooting at them and trying to kill them and they managed to escape, but Delacroix writes about this instance as being, it was one of his more memorable life threatening experiences in North Africa, but had a poetic element to it.

So he decides to paint this bathing scene on commission and he incorporates the memory of that experience. And you can tell from the women in the foreground who are wearing North African garb. It was something that's much poetic and traditional.  The scene from a poem by the Renaissance poet Torquato Tasso, he's merging an actual poetic idea with an experience and he is doing it all within the context of painting outdoors at his estate in Champrosay because he has become fascinated with the scientific study of color and the effects of light on color and objects and nature.

Eric Bruce:  Hear about Delacroix's rivalry with the artist Courbet by pressing the Green button.

**10G**

Patrick Noon: He is really trying to create a unified pictorial surface.  He is painting the flesh tones and the landscape tones at the same time and they are basically either complementary or quite strongly contrasting.  So you are modeling with color rather than with line or with tone.  And he is doing that because he is totally offended by what his colleagues are doing in the realist camp, especially Courbet.

As he is painting this picture he writes about Courbet's _Bathers_, what Courbet has done is he has painted a landscape in the studio and then he has painted this figure and pasted it on top, there is no integration of the surface, there is no integration.  And this, to Delacroix, is stupid and it makes no sense.  He writes, it's boorish, you know the man has no taste and why is he doing this and etc., etc.  And then he goes back to it later and he says, what, how can he paint this picture this way and not have the figure integrated visually within the landscape.  That's not realism, that's just silly.  He is just preoccupied with this issue.  You know it's going to become an issue for every artist, how do you create this integrated pictorial surface where everything is in-sync and nothing stands out, nothing looks that like it's artificial or pasted, so optically how do you create this with paint.

And that's really what the significance of this picture is, although it was painted on commission for someone who said, I want a bathing scene.  So he said, okay and he did it but he had so many motives in taking this on because he did not paint many nudes.  I believe he took this commission on and satisfied it because he wanted to really have a crack at Courbet.

David Marquis:  Some of these figures are made by the paint that's put around the figures, and that is so different than Neoclassical paint.  This figure would have been completely finished and then the color would have gone around it.  But this figure is defined and created by the color that's placed around all the flesh tones.  And he changes that color as he needs to, to create that whole and that's such an important concept about painting, it seems obvious but it wasn't obvious.  That is not how painting was done.

If you look in this figure in the far right, you see how that greenish turquoise tone intensifies that pinkish red and that's because again they are getting to be close to opposites on the color wheel.  And who would think of making it a green as a shadow, I mean that was unheard of.

To me Cézanne takes the lessons of Delacroix and he just takes it even a few steps further and looking, at his seeing _The Bathers_ and you see the same dabs of color only they are a little bit larger dabs of color.  You see the importance of the direction of those dabs of color.  You don't just see a green, you see a blue-green, a yellow-green and there is very little use of value in this painting, it's really about color.  If you look at the flesh tones and the figure on the far right of the bathers, you look and you see a perfect example, the use of warm and cool, you see those pinkish tones next to that green color that he is using for the shadow.  That is so different than the way the Neoclassicists used color.

If you put the right colors next to a blue which is considered a cool color you can actually make it look hot or warm and make it advance, depending on what you put next to it.  So it's all getting back to that principle of a color only exist in relation to its neighbor and understanding how we perceive color is so important in understanding these artists because they were exploring this and learning on their paintings and on the palette, how these colors interact.

During the Renaissance every color had a meaning, it represented something whereas for them it's not necessarily descriptive and it's not symbolic, it's just about color it's about the interaction of color.

Value is when you take a color and you add black to any color, it makes it darker. When you add white to any color, it makes it lighter but not necessarily brighter so there is a difference between bright and light, both a light color and a bright color will advance next to a dark color or a dull color to different degrees depending on everything else.

Patrick Noon: Delacroix was a very prolific painter of religious subjects.  Religious painting was in the air, it was something that most artists were practicing that was revival of religious painting, and he did say when he was painting religious subjects that they provided him with the widest latitude for his creative imagination.

Of  Delacroix's religious painting, Baudelaire wrote, "All that there is of anguish in Christ's Passion impassions Delacroix."  I think he did actually relate to them in a spiritual way.  He was not a very religious man but he recognized the virtue and the strength of religious subject matter in Christ's Passion, but he only chooses a certain number of scenes or topics from the life of Christ.  I mean Delacroix basically says, painting is just a bridge between the imagination of the artist and the imagination of the viewer.

How do you move that imagination, that spiritualism and that whatever you want to call it in the viewer.  Illustration doesn't do it, I mean you can take a subject and illustrate it carefully so that the narrative is understood, but the actual emotive quality of that illustration or the emotive potential isn't being felt because you are not describing it.  Whereas in a picture like this or any of these things you are not reacting to the story, you are being moved by the way the artist has interpreted and presented the story by way of his technique and using paint and using color, and it's become the bridge and you get there by whatever means you need to get there.

Eric Bruce:  Baudelaire describes Delacroix's work as blood, light and darkness.  Press the Green button to hear why.

**12G**

Patrick Noon: Baudelaire describes Delacroix's religious paintings as blood, light and darkness in that there is sort of certain that combines blood, light and darkness.

Christ's body just radiates light out of this darkness and there is this incredible glow of flesh and you know the idea of it being that dark and that his body is so bright, just it creates an extraordinary sense of space, but yes the three crosses are on the hill in the background with a little bit of light behind him but it's essentially a nocturnal scene.  And that red, the red we are seeing is really sober note.  It was Gautier, Théophile Gautier, the poet says of the red of St. John's Cloak, a lot of critics were highly critical of that, and yet he writes that the garish red in this otherwise muted color harmony invest the entire canvas with great sorrow.

Baudelaire writes of the most remarkable of the artist's qualities, this is what he says, the most remarkable of the artist's qualities and that which makes him the true painter of the 19th Century.  He is unrivalled at expressing not merely suffering, but above all moral suffering, and here lies the prodigious mystery of his painting.  The poses and the gestures of the Marys are so evocative of this great melancholy suffering that isn't physical, it has to do with psychological and spiritual suffering.

Eric Bruce:  Patrick Noon, Head Curator of this exhibition will share insights into these next three paintings.

Patrick Noon:  Van Gogh was totally enamored of Delacroix's religious subject matter because he was a very religious person himself but also his color theory.  Van Gogh basically learned about Delacroix through publications when he was in art school in the Netherlands.  So he finally decides he is going to go to Paris in 1886.  He arrives and he writes back immediately, there is a lot to see here especially Delacroix.

At one auction, he sees a painting, he becomes transfixed by and it's _Christ on the Sea of Galilee_.  He writes how extraordinary Delacroix's use of chrome yellow and Prussian blue.  And he becomes fixated on this juxtaposition of that yellow halo and the deep blues and greens of the water in this picture.  He starts painting pictures that are based on chrome yellow and Prussian blue, all series of pictures where that's basically the main palette.

And so Vincent Van Gogh ends up in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.  And while he is at the asylum, he has with him a black and white lithograph which reproduces a painting by Delacroix of the Pieta and decides he is going to make a copy of it which we have here.  And he copies this painting which he had never seen, and he makes this painting which is twice the size of Delacroix's original painting.  But he is painting it in a palette of blue and yellow.  He is painting it as if this is the way Delacroix would have used these colors in this kind of composition.

He also then puts his own features on Christ.  He is doing the copy of Delacroix's _Pieta_ at the same time as he is painting the olive grove series.  So there is an infusion of a religious sentiment into what he sees as totally naturalistic and realistic depictions from nature without having to do this kind of introduction of figures which he doesn't think modern artists are capable of doing.

Eric Bruce:  Imagine these two intense artists, Cézanne and Van Gogh, working together in a small room.  The green button will tell you all about their big fight.

**13G**

Patrick Noon: Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin were probably two of the most ardent admirers of Delacroix's work in Paris.  Van Gogh went to the Arles to set up the Studio of the South, and he wanted to invite a huge number of younger artists to come down and they would have this community and they would be, they would produce great art. He couldn't interest anybody except Gauguin whom he knew in Paris.  They painted together and they apparently had really heated conversations about what art is, and Van Gogh was a very demanding person.  And I think it just got really bad in terms of the relationship with the two of these guys together in a room and trying to first of all make ends meet and then come to some understanding about what each of them wants to try to do with art.  But in the end they had a falling out, and Van Gogh went off and came back with his ear cut off, and I think that was the end of that for Gauguin, he was not going to stay around anymore.  Shortly thereafter Van Gogh committed himself to an asylum to try to recover.

While he is there, he gets a letter from Gauguin, and Gauguin has in this letter a sketch, he must have known from Theo that Van Gogh was painting olive trees. He had nothing else he could do there, he didn't have money for models, so he was painting the olive trees.  Van Gogh related olive trees to Delacroix because he felt that Delacroix had you know actually seen them and when he went south and that he understood them.

So I think Gauguin must have got wind of the fact that Van Gogh was painting olive trees at the asylum and he sends this letter in which he includes little sketch of a painting he has just completed called _Christ in the Garden of Olives_ which we have in the show.  And in that picture he says I've done something very synthetic. I've taken color to its extremes and he has put his features and Van Gogh's hair on the figure of Christ. The figure of Christ itself he has borrowed from a Delacroix, another Delacroix image that he knew.

Van Gogh gets very upset.  He says this is wrong, you shouldn't be doing this.  There are only two people in the world who were able to paint Christ, one was Rembrandt and the other was Delacroix, and we have no business doing this.  You should really be painting your garden.  Gauguin writes back and he says, okay, you know I am sorry.  I didn't mean to offend, and Van Gogh writes to Theo and says, they are driving me crazy with the Christ in the Gardens.  So I've been out in olive groves painting every day and I have done five pictures so far, one of which is the painting in the show.

Eric Bruce:  Again here is Christopher Riopelle, curator of post-1800 paintings at the London National Gallery and exhibition co-curator.

Christopher Riopelle:  Cézanne, whom we think of for the enormously grand and placid landscapes and still-life's of his later years. Rich formal experiments in picture making.  Well, he started out in a very different way, he started out coming up from the south of France from Provence as this kind of violent uncontrolled person painting both stylistically in a very brutal way, I mean he really trowels the paint on, but also psychologically all of his early pictures are haunted by this kind of unremitting violence. It's as if psychologically he couldn't control himself.

Here you see him in 67 at the height of his, the most violent imagination and very aggressive manner of painting, but at the same time, an artist like Delacroix would recognize himself in it because Delacroix himself had painted often very violent and sexually fraught subject matter.  Cézanne admired him enormously and also Delacroix was a painter who knew his classical antiquity.  Cézanne also admired this very much in him, and in a picture like _The Rape_ it's not just a rape scene, it's as if we are being told a story from classical antiquity. We can't quite put our finger on what the story is, but it has an air of timelessness to it at the same time.  I think with a picture like this, we see a young and very struggling artist and also one full of passion and intensity recognizing in Delacroix his scenes of tumult and violence a way forward an artist who knew how to handle things like that.  And Cézanne is in the exhibition to show an artist who would go on to very, very great things, struggling, and that sense of struggle is very important, struggling with Delacroix's legacy.

Eric Bruce:  What was Cézanne's state of mind when making this painting?  The Green button will lead you to through some of his choices in this very strange picture.

**14G**

Christopher Riopelle: It's a very strange picture.  I sometimes thought it's as if we are seeing it in a flash of lightening, it's \*boom\*, it's all of a sudden there and half a second from now we are not going to be able to see it.  Also there is the tremendous amount of paint on that canvas.  I mean he has really troweled on the paint to build up those forms of it; they almost have a three-dimensional quality to them.

There are a number of very conventional elements if you will, for example in traditional academic art of scenes from classical antiquity, French artists often made a distinction between the man's body which is very ruddy, reddish etc. and the woman's body which is very pale and white.  This was a kind of academic code for making a distinction between men and women and in this picture Cézanne still uses that very old fashioned formula.  And I think that's one of the reasons that we start to wonder, well is he telling us a classical story, is this some kind of myth?

Another element are off to the left that group of naked women languoring on the bank of the river they seem completely oblivious to what's going on, it isn't bothering them in the slightest as if they were nymphs that have wandered in from ancient Greece.  And then in the distance you see what might even be the first appearance in Cézanne's art which would become one of the great motifs of his art and that is Mont Sainte-Victoire, this great table top kind of mountain from his native Provence, he could see it from where he lived.  But here I think it is evoking for him the kind of timeless Mediterranean realm.

In brief the thing that's so fascinating about this Cézanne is his sense of a timeless story being told and mixed with it the sense that Cézanne is almost on the edge of losing it.

Eric Bruce:  Lamar Peterson is an artist and Assistant Professor of Drawing and Painting at the University of Minnesota's Department of Art.

Lamar Peterson:  Delacroix is definitely one of my favorite artists. His sense of drama in his work is something that I think about in my own work as well.  And he was working from his imagination starting with an inspiration or an idea or a theme and then taking that to the realm of the imagination and making something that you necessarily would not see in the natural world.

I don't think that he actually witnessed a Lion Hunt.  So this is all from his imagination and this lion hunt is very, very disturbing and almost tragic but there is something about it, it also has cinematographic feeling.  Certain parts of the composition are so dense with information, it allows you to rest on a certain spot of the composition and move through other places within the painting and notice things that you may not have noticed the first time you viewed the piece. And I really enjoy that being able to look at work of art and seeing something different every time you view it.

There is circular composition going on where you kind of start off with the hunter on the horse in the back and his spear lifted, he is further from the action of the hunt itself, further in the back. He looks a little surprised to me. The horse is startled, one hoof or leg is raised.  Just below him, a poor unfortunate man has been murdered or eaten or killed or maimed by one of the lions and he is lying face down.  There is two hunters engaged in battle with a male lion trying to take the attention from the lion's goal to kill another hunter.  It's just in the grips of the lion's claws.

Next to him is another man who looks like he has lost his shoe, a little shoe to me visually adds a lot to the composition.  Gives you a place to settle your eye and think about that shoe and think about how you are looking at a moment in time. A little detail there leaves a lot to think about. Really interesting that he added that single shoe there, separate from the action of the battle.

To the left part of the composition of the painting you have a fallen horse, this lioness' paw scratching into the belly of the mare as she is dragging across her belly and there is places where you see that there is blood, you know there is pain there.  And there is another hunter that's just fallen off the horse and again looks surprised and unsure of what to do next, he has his sword that's on the ground and it looks like he is just fallen off and he is about leap to his feet again and maybe try to attempt to kill the lioness that stopped to devour his fallen horse.

Then we have one single hunter in the background holding a spear in an action pose, he is about to spear the lioness, again he is further away in the distance.  There is so much going on in his painting that I keep finding different ways to interpret what has happened here.

Eric Bruce:  The Green button will take you to Lamar's personal exploration of how Delacroix influences his work.

**15G**

Lamar Peterson:   These reds are so vivid and deep. The blood as well as the hunter's cloaks are very intense and bright.  Also the use of light as well and modeling on the lioness' fur as well as the fabric of the hunters is very dramatic and intense.  I think, he had an eye for the drama of an image bringing in the viewer with something that might be shocking, holding their view and engaging them, allowing the viewer to walk away and have so many different directions that they could take what they have just viewed.

It's obvious that he was making work for himself.  He was making work that excited him and it's definitely something that I think about in my own work. How can I make work for myself and second guess it and let it speak for itself when it's out in the world?

**16**

Patrick Noon:  This picture is inspired by Richard Wagner's opera, Tannhauser.  Fantin would go on; become one of the most important flower painters in France.  But at this point he is thinking about doing history subjects and illustrations to literature and opera.  And Wagner's first appearance in Paris was in 1861, and it was a production of Tannhauser that Fantin had gone to.

What was typical of conservative French critics, when something came from a foreign source, they were not very happy to support it.  And in fact they attacked Wagner's production.  The attack was so vehement in the press.  And with actual people in the audience who were planted there to create a row that the production was cancelled, after three performances.

This had echoes of what had happened in the 1820s, when a British troupe tried to present Shakespeare in Paris, the same thing happened then. And then in 1830, when Victor Hugo tried to stage Hernani.  Fantin of course was very, very sympathetic to Wagner.

Fantin decided that in the same exhibition when he was going to show his homage to Delacroix, he was going to show this illustration to Wagner's Tannhauser.  And what makes it interesting really is that it's executed in a style that's very dependent on Delacroix's late mural style and the palette is very Delacroix.  Clearly as a technical exercise, it's clearly as much an homage to Delacroix as the more literal.  So these two pictures would have been side-by-side and they have a similar kind of message.

It also reflects the fascination of that moment (Fantin shared with Baudelaire, Manet, many artists including Delacroix) in synesthesia which is an actual neurological condition, at that time it was a very, the artist were very interested in a blending of senses so that if you stimulated one sense it simultaneously produces a sensation in a different sense.  So quite literally, you hear colors, you feel sounds, you taste shapes. And they were fascinated by this and it explains probably Fantin's interest in illustrating this Wagner. It also explains Manet's giving the title _Music in the Tuileries_ to his first modernist painting when there isn't any evidence of a musician or an instrument anywhere in sight. It probably has a lot to do with Redon's admission that Delacroix's Apollo ceiling is a modern symphony.  And it certainly has everything to do with Whistler suddenly titling all of his pictures in the 1860s the symphony of this, symphony number one, symphony that, symphony in black etc, etc.

These references to music, it all is related to this notion of synesthesia and whether Delacroix believed in it or not, I think he did or at least he had some sense that it was probably true.  He does write about when he is doing murals in the church as he is working on the mural, he is hearing music but it's not being performed and it's not hallucination, it's something being triggered in his mind.



**17**

Christopher Riopelle:  Degas's story, in a funny way; it's not at all that different from Cézanne.  Degas growing up in considerable wealth in Paris visiting his family in Italy and Florence and Naples. Very well educated and sophisticated. Very, very much wanting to be a serious history painter, wanting to paint the great subjects of literature of classical antiquity, of Christianity.  And seeing in the 1850s, as he was just coming up, Delacroix as the great model for how to do that.  Delacroix always willing to take on the vastest, most important, most resonant themes of antiquity or Christianity or literature. Really from the 1850s you get Degas almost imitating Delacroix, choosing the kinds of subject matter that Delacroix might have chosen.

Including in this case the story of Alexander the Great who as a young man is given this horse Bucephalus, whom no one thinks can be broken. And he trains him. He recognizes that the glorious steed is actually afraid of his own shadow, and so turns him towards the sun so that the shadow is behind him and as were calms him down.

He is able to mount him and he becomes Alexander's great horse.  So it is the moment at which it's recognized, and Alexander in this story is just a youth of, I don't know, 12 or 14. It is recognized that he has the skills of a great leader.  And it's exactly the kind of story taken from antiquity that Delacroix admired and could do things with.

Eric Bruce:  Press the Green button to explore why Degas wanted to make big traditional history paintings.

**17G**

Christopher Riopelle: One of the tests when you have this kind of ambition in painting, is to create a picture with as many figures as possible, very, very busy. And that was one of the great tests of your skill that you could bring a large number of figures into visual control, and that certainly is one of the things he is doing here.  It is Degas as a very young man showing off, showing what he could do and what he could not quite do, because of course it's an unfinished picture.  He abandoned it at a certain moment, we don't know why. Perhaps because he realized he wasn't going to pull it off as fully as he wanted. But during the very late 50s, early 60s, long before ballet dances or anything like that, all of his paintings were these very ambitious history pictures.

And interestingly, Degas was probably the last of the great modern artists still to want to do that.  Manet as we have seen with _Music in the Tuileries_ had moved beyond that, he wanted to paint modern life, he didn't want to paint something from ancient Greece. And he was older than Degas. But for Degas, up until about 1865, to paint that big grand kind of history painting remained his chief ambition.  He realized that it was no longer selling, and I don't only mean financially, but it somehow no longer carried the conviction it once had that led him to move towards modern subject matter like the ballet.

David Marquis:  If you look at how the space is constructed in this, you see cooler violets and blues in the background, and the yellow and the pinks and the reds coming forward in space. But that principle of brighter coming forward is perfectly exemplified in this red which is darker than the pink next to it, but it's closer to a true red in the color wheel.  And so it comes forward to our eye because it's so close to a primary red, we are getting close to a primary red and essentially he understands that and that's how he is using that.

Now we are getting into an almost Pointillist technique, so the dabs of color are becoming smaller and this whole idea that your eye will put together these dabs of color and make a unified whole.  If you note the direction, the direction of the dots is important because in some cases he is using a vertical dab, in some cases it's horizontal and I think that's really important.  But even more important is how the violet in the background along the horizon line is made up of so many colors that when you walk up to the painting it's all these dabs of colors but then when you stand back and you get viewing distance, your eye puts together all those colors and creates a very rich unified form.

But again, this surface has that same unified feeling that we see in the Delacroix painting which is so different, but at the same time you look at this and you go, this is all being worked on simultaneously because all these colors are so influencing one another, they have to be changed and adapted as the artist moves through creating this composition as a whole.

Eric Bruce:  David Marquis worked on the restoration of this painting.  He will tell you all about it, when you press the Green button.

**18G**

David Marquis:  This painting the museum has is a very early working as 1904.  I am so struck by and this one I worked in on the Messinger, came in. It had a varnish, a varnish had yellowed, was very dark.  You couldn't see these colors.  So when I was removing the varnish and years of grime, the cleaning was incredibly dramatic and it was like we are seeing the painting as it was intended to be seen for the first time in probably you know 60, 70 years.

And it was a revelation to Patrick; it was revelation to me.  The incredible beauty and well-organized color.  It's so well thought out and so well organized and yet it feels like he just did it in the afternoon on a day out in the field, he is working at his easel and just threw this thing together and yet the more you look at it, the more you realize, wow this is so well thought out. The proportions of the color, the placement of the colors, the overall design, the fact that this green in the lower corner keeps your eye from drifting off. If you take that green out of the lower right corner, and just have that path go all the way out, your eye would just drift off, but this holds you in and it keeps your eye moving around the design.  I was stunned by the composition and how almost classical.  There is nothing accidental in this painting.

**19**

David Marquis:  This is _Boulevard de Clichy_ by Signac painted in 1886.  Signac was a Post Impressionist working in sort of pointillist technique, and he continued to work in this manner for most of his life.  _Boulevard de Clichy_, it has the impression of just having happened.  It was a moment in time, he didn't think this out, he painted this in a few moments looking out his window.  And he captured the essence of this moment in time, and yet when I really stand back and I start to analyze it, I realize there is nothing accidental in this painting.  This is really extremely well thought out.

He gives you the impression that it was a snapshot in time.  He got it all to work so incredibly well: the proportions of the color or the placement of the colors, the warm, the cool, the space. Everything it just works.  And your eye constantly moves around this very active surface.  You can't keep your eyes still, your eye just wants to move and keep embracing every single passage, and it's delightful when that happens, when you look at a picture. You take it in all at once and then at the same time, your eye just keeps moving around, being caressed, for lack of a better word, by every passage in this.

Eric Bruce:  The green button will take you to a tour of the painting and how Signac uniquely uses Delacroix's ideas about color.

**19G**

David Marquis:  This another just wonderful picture, the tracks of the carriages and trolleys in the snow, these sort of muddy, a lot of the muddy colors.  He is using the color of the canvas as a color, but he is surrounding it in such a way that he is making it look like it's dirt and slush. That's back to those same principle that color only exists in relation to its neighbor.

He is making a color from the canvas by what he surrounds that color with.  Now in fairness the canvas has probably darkened somewhat over time, it probably was lighter color originally so the contrast is probably not quite so great.  So the streets probably didn't look quite so dirty, but the principle is still there.  In that you see all kinds of areas of this painting, if you look at it closely, you see areas where the canvas is showing through and being used by the artist as a color and as an integral part of the composition.

If you look along the borders in the sky and certainly look at the tracks of the trolleys you will see the bare canvas showing through, you will also see it in his building.  On the right side you will some of the raw canvas showing through, building is sort of brick.  And pay particular attention to how he is making this wonderful brick color by dabs of blue and orange with some vermillion red and he is creating, really he is creating the color of brick, but not by mixing brown and white but by making, combining all these colors knowing how they interact with one another.  And when you stand back and look at it, it says 'brick,' but when you look at up close, it's just dabs of color.

And the trees, the same way you look at the tree trunks, they are not just black and white, or brown and white, they are made up of blues and violets and reds, all kinds of colors, but your eye mixes those colors when you stand back. And it creates a very rich color that says 'tree' in a way that you can't do by doing it with just value.  Again each artist took those principles of color, simultaneous contrast, warm and cool, bright and dull, and they incorporated them into their painting in a slightly different way depending on their personality and their interest and that's the wonderful thing about the starting point of Delacroix. They're using the same principles, but none of their paintings look like Delacroix, and I love that, I love that they are so personal.

Patrick Noon: It's this circle of Fantin-Latour, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and other artists who in the 1860s primarily in England and then rapidly in France who were beginning to promote this idea of art for the sake of art and not for the sake of propaganda, exposition, narrative, nothing, just pure painting.

It is about avoiding any kind of subject that someone may try to interpret.  You're not going to try to interpret a basket of fruit, it is what it is.  He just wanted to paint beautiful things, beautifully colored things in their natural setting and that's what he did with these still lifes.

So they became the means of experimenting with different types of technical invention: fast drying varnish instead of oil as the medium for his pigments, that kind of thing, you see that in these floral studies.  But he was always found of flowers and in landscape and nature and from the earliest date when he would visit George Sand at her house in Nohant, he would do studies in watercolor, flowers and vegetation. And then when he purchased his own private estate in Champrosay, which is a small town outside of Paris, but it's adjacent to a forest, and he would go there quite often in the last decades of his life just to escape society and the profession in Paris.  And he would spend days there and he'd write about his observations of flowers and nature. In fact discovered most of his important perception and optics while walking around the forest of Champrosay.

Eric Bruce:  The Green button will share how Delacroix's garden in this painting had an impact on other artists.  Why did Delacroix start painting still-lifes for the first time at the end of his life?  Find out by pressing the red button.

**20G**

Patrick Noon: When he wasn't able to travel to Champrosay anymore because he was too ill, he found great comfort in his garden.  And this garden became somewhat of a famous place for younger artists to visit because his studio was still there after he died, and you could still get into the studio while his housekeeper was still alive. And a lot of times the artists would try to get in and experience the studio and the garden and Monet and Bazille actually rented a studio that overlooked Delacroix's for about a year right after Delacroix's death.

When these were shown in 1849, they were really praised as bravura examples of pure painting.  And I think subsequent artists' fascination with them was because of that. And they tried to either own or copy or meditate on these things, Degas for instance was collecting the still-life sketches. And Cézanne very fairly late in life wanted to acquire this and did acquire a very important large Delacroix watercolor of a floral arrangement when he was just so fascinated by this particular watercolor that he traded some pictures with the dealer Vollard to acquire it, and then he made a copy of it, an oil copy, for himself.



**20R**

Patrick Noon: 1848/49 that was a year of social and political turmoil throughout Europe.  The 1848 Revolution which displaced huge numbers of people, in that year Delacroix decided he is going to paint a series of monumental still-lifes, he hadn't painted still-lifes in his entire life.  And he begins five, he finally finishes two which he is satisfied with and he sends those to the 1849 Salon.

His point in painting these still-lifes, which he had never done before, was simply to either amuse himself also he is involved in, still at this point painting murals, so probably a way of relaxing as well and not having to think too much about what you are painting and the message you are trying to communicate. But he does say, he wanted to avoid hackwork that he said appears to condemn flower painters by making the same vase sitting on the same column and with the same array of flowers.  And what he really wanted to do, was to make what he called morsels of nature in a natural setting.  So you have this little group of fruit in a flower garden.  And these are non-narrative pictures, they are really about painting, they are really about color, that's it.

So he exhibits them in the Salon but neither of them were purchased by anyone.  So the whole group of five end up staying in his studio.  And periodically he would bring them out for exhibition.  In 1855 there was a big exhibition of his work.  And then in 1860/61 a dealer in Paris offered to show all five of these pictures in his gallery.  At that very moment everybody in Paris starts painting floral still-lifes.

Monet, one of the Monet's very first paintings is a floral still-life.  Renoir: floral still-lifes. They tell Bazille, their friend who came from Bordeaux, he really should paint still-lifes.  So it becomes this incredible fashion, even an artist like Gustave Courbet who was the antithesis of Delacroix in terms of his approach to art, takes up still-life painting in 1862, and _The Trellis_ which is in our exhibition by Courbet is probably the most beautiful of those examples.

Christopher Riopelle: The argument of the exhibition, if you will, is that you see here in those years 1906, 1907, 1910 the modern adulation and emulation of Delacroix now 50 years after his death, and the way artist had used him kept changing over those 50 years.  And now with the Frenchman Matisse and then Russian Kandinksy, both of them huge admirers of Delocroix, moving beyond him into a new world. Of Matisse in the direction of color, broad patterning of forms in a way that owes a debt to Delacroix's brilliant use of color but now in a fully modern way.

Christopher Riopelle: Coming from Russia, I suppose you might even say the most spiritual of nations, Kandinsky was always interested in something more than mere representation.  He wanted it to encompass spiritual values.  Looking at Delacroix when he got to Paris he was seeing an artist, in particularly in some of his late religious works, who was moving beyond mere representation into something that in its boldness of paint handling etc., rose to a spiritual level.

Kandinsky grabbed onto that movement from representation pushing it further so that you could see spiritual elements entering into the art.  That is very much what pushed him in the direction of an abstraction that Delacroix himself would never have understood, Delacroix always thought of himself as a representational artist, but if as it were you pushed what Delacroix had done to its extreme of freedom, you would arrive at abstraction and that's, I think, the adventure of what you are seeing in the Kandinsky is that process going on.

Eric Bruce:  Press the green button to hear about the hidden forms in Kandinsky's painting.

Christopher Riopelle:  One of the other concerns beyond pure color in abstraction was the way in which certain forms in Kandinsky themselves carried a charge of meaning or a charge of expressivity so that for example, some of these tall forms or curving forms themselves were emotional in an of themselves.  So that the leaping horse, can you see it on the upper right, has a sense I would say, even before you figure out that it almost represents a horse and rider.  It communicates something of joy, similarly at the lower right is that a kneeling figure? It communicates something of morning of sadness because it's a low huddled form.

And Kandinsky was very, very concerned to work out the implications of pure form in his pictures. And of course looking back he could see the Delacroix, while always remaining representational, was doing certain of the same things. That we would read into a huddled figure in one of his paintings a certain emotion, even if we didn't know what the story was. Or we would read joy into a dancing figure or something, that meaning did not only reside in description but in the pure forms themselves.
